        "content": "PTI Photo\n\nIndia's batting legend Sachin Tendulkar has thanked the Maharashtra Government 's decision to build a statue of his childhood coach, the Late Ramakant Achrekar , at the Shivaji Park in Mumbai.\"Achrekar Sir has had an immense impact on my life and several other lives. I am speaking on behalf of all his students. His life revolved around cricket in Shivaji Park. Being at Shivaji Park forever is what he would have wished for.I am very happy with the government’s decision to build a statue for Achrekar Sir at his karmabhoomi,\" Tendulkar posted on X (formerly Twitter).The announcement was made on Wednesday, a day ahead of the National Sports Day, which is also the birth anniversary of hockey legend Major Dhyan Chand.The Government of Maharashtra on Wednesday issued a Government Resolution (GR) permitting the installation of the monument in memory of the famous cricket coach who mentored Tendulkar and several other India players during their formative years at the famed Shivaji Park on an open space near gate No. 5.The idea to build a memorial for Achrekar at the Shivaji Park was initiated, and continuously followed up by one of Achrekar's students, Sunil Ramachandran, who is the former captain of the Kamat Memorial Cricket Club and is presently the assistant general secretary of the Shivaji Park Gymkhana.\"It was possible because of the guidance and support of (MNS chief) Raj Thackeray,\" Ramachandran, told TOI.A winner of the prestigious Dronacharya award, Achrekar, who passed away on January 2, 2019, at the age of 87, mentored 14 players who went on to play for India. These are Ramnath Parkar, Eknath Solkar, Balwinder Singh Sandhu, Lalchand Rajput, Chandrakant Pandit, Pravin Amre, Tendulkar, Vinod Kambli, Sameer Dighe, Sanjay Bangar, Paras Mhambrey, Ramesh Powar, Ajit Agarkar and Sairaj Bahutule.\"There will be a ball, helmet, gloves and pad and his name inscribed on the memorial. The bat will have signatures of all the 14 India cricketers that he coached, starting from (India’s 1983 World Cup hero) Balwinder Singh Sandhu to Bharat Ratna and cricket icon Tendulkar,\" Ramachandran said.The monument is likely to be ready in the next couple of months and will be inaugurated by Tendulkar.",

        "content": "Maharashtra State Sports Commissioner Omprakash Bakoria has written to the BCCI seeking “strict action” against India U-19 World Cup-winning member Rajvardhan Hangargekar for age fraud.\n\nIn a letter dated February 8, Bakoria wrote to BCCI secretary Jay Shah that the pacer had altered his birth date from January 10, 2001 to November 10, 2002 and was thus over-age when he competed in the recently-concluded U-19 World Cup.\n\n“The conduct of Mr Rajvardhan Hangangekar is against the sports integrity and ethics. It deprives fair play and results into damages to the reputation of the nation. Therefore, you are requested to take strict action in accordance with the law,” Bakoria wrote.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe letter has also been marked to secretary of Maharashtra Cricket Association Riyaz Bagban.\n\nBakoria further wrote, “As per the inquiry and the report, it reveals that Mr Rajvardhan Hangargekar has started his academic career from Terna Public School, Osmanabad. It is governed by the school code prescribed by the Government of Maharashtra.” “At the time of admission of Rajvardhan Hangargekar in 1st standard at Terna Public School (primary division) Osmanabad, the date of birth is provided as 10/01/2001. The school record speaks that the birth date of Mr Rajvardhan Hangagekar up to seventh standard is recorded as 10/01/2001.” The commissioner alleged that the school made “unauthorised corrections” to Hangargekar’s birth date.\n\n“As per the general register maintained by the Terna Public School, Osmanabad, his birth date is 10/01/2001. It appears unauthorised corrections (were) made by the Head Master and his birth date is recorded as 10/11/2002 at the time of fresh application for 8th standard.” “If the headmaster requires any corrections in the birth date, it is necessary to take prior permission of the education officer of the concerned district. However, no such permission has been taken for making changes in the birth date of Mr Rajvardhan Hangargekar.\n\n“Therefore said corrections are made in excess of power and amount to cheating and forgery in government records,” the senior IAS officer stated.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nLast week, Hangargekar was bought by Chennai Super Kings for Rs 1.5 crore at the IPL 2022 mega auction.\n\n“On the basis of the fabricated record, Mr Rajvardhan Hangargekar seems to have secured a position in the national team of India. As per the report of Chief Executive Officer (IAS) Zilla Parishad, Osmanabad, the birth date of said player is 10/01/2001 and therefore, he has completed 21 years of age at the time of the tournament.\n\n“Despite of the fact, he has secured a position in the U19 team participating in the ICC (U-19) World Cup 2022.” The PTI tried to contact Maharashtra Cricket Association secretary Bagban and Hangargekar for a response, but both could not be reached.\n\nEarlier Manjot Karla, who struck a match-winning century in the final of 2018 U-19 World Cup, was banned for two years from playing for Delhi, for age fraud.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nIn September 2011, Maharashtra’s Ankit Bawne was removed from India U-19 squad after the date of birth in his passport did not match with the one in his birth certificate and the BCCI records.",

        "content": "Overview of situation of sport in Indian state, Maharashtra\n\nSports play an integral part of culture in the Indian state of Maharashtra. Cricket is the most popular spectator sport in the state. Other popular sports include kabaddi and kho kho, which are played in rural areas, and field hockey, badminton, and table tennis, which are more common in urban areas, schools, and colleges. In the state's southern rural regions, annual wrestling championships such as Hind Kesari and Maharashtra Kesari are held. Games like Viti-Dandu and variations of Tag are played among children.\n\nThe Mumbai cricket team represents Mumbai, Palghar, and Thane districts in Indian domestic cricket, whilst the Maharashtra cricket team represents the rest of the state. Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) governs cricket in the state except for the Mumbai region. The state is home to international standard stadiums including Wankhede stadium in Mumbai and Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune. In the Indian Premier League (IPL), the Mumbai Indians franchise represents the state from Mumbai; the women's team plays in the Women's Premier League. The Maharashtra Open, a tennis ATP Tour 250 tournament, is annually held in Balewadi Stadium, Pune.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nPre-colonial sports [ edit ]\n\nIn ancient India, a martial art called mallavidya was practiced. It was a form of grappling that was more complex than wrestling, and was performed in earthen mud pits called akhadas or talims, some of which can still be found in Maharashtra today. Historical depictions of the martial art can be seen on archaeological sculptures from the region at numerous locations, such as Kharosa or Pavnar.[1]\n\nBaji Rao II, the last Peshwa of the Maratha Empire, was a patron of strength and wrestling competitions during the early 19th century. Under his patronage, the sport of malkhamb (pole gymnastics) was developed in Pune by Balambhat Deodhar. After Baji Rao lost power and was exiled to northern India, Deodhar brought malkhamb and mallavidya to other Maratha-ruled states such as Baroda and Gwalior. In the later 19th and early 20th centuries, other rulers such as those of Kolhapur and Aundh were also patrons of organised wrestling and sporting festivals.[2] Among the rulers of these princely states, horse riding, wrestling, fencing, archery, and shooting gained popularity.[3]\n\nImported sports under British rule [ edit ]\n\nBritish rule in India drastically changed the landscape of sports in Maharastra. Like in other regions of India, British rulers and aristocrats enjoyed outdoor sports and built facilities for their own leisure.[4] This led to the introduction of several British sports, including cricket, and the development of the new game of badminton.[5] New infrastructure—such as the building of a dam at Bund Garden in 1860—allowed for recreational boating on the Mula-Mutha river.[6] In addition, the colonial rulers introduced horse racing; some racecourses built during this period, such as the Mahalaxmi Racecourse and Pune Race Course, are still in operation today.[7][8]\n\nBy the late 19th century, the British had constructed numerous sports clubs that were exclusively white or restricted based on religion, such as Poona Europeans, Poona Parsees, and Poona Hindu Gymkhana. While many of the religion-based clubs were dominated by educated Brahmins, there were also some lower-caste sports stars such as the brothers Palwankar Baloo and Vithal Palwankar, who played cricket in the early 20th century.[7][8]\n\nIndigenous sports under British rule [ edit ]\n\nAt the same time that imported sports were being developed by the British, indigenous sports continued to change and develop. However, after Indian Civil Service officer Walter Rand was assassinated in 1897 by the Chapekar brothers who ran a wrestling venue in Pune, British colonial authorities viewed these indigenous sports venues with suspicion.[9] A committee was established in 1914 in order to set rules for kho-kho.[10] The formalization of Indian sports continued in the region, and the Deccan Gymkhana sports club was instrumental in organizing the first Indian delegation to an Olympic games, which participated in the 1920 games in Antwerp.[11] Other clubs, such as the Maharashtra Mandal club, which formed in the early 20th century, promoted physical culture and education by hosting both indigenous and Western sports.[9][12]\n\nOther indigenous sports and exercises developed as well, especially yoga. In the 1920s, Bhawanrao Shriniwasrao Pant Pratinidhi, the ruler of Aundh State, helped popularize the series of yoga positions called Surya Namaskar, a flowing sequence of salutations to the sun. This series contained popular asanas (positions) such as upward and downward dog and Uttanasana which helped to popularize yoga as exercise.[13]\n\nBeginning in the 1910s, local Indian organizations were established in order to propagate and develop Indian physical culture. One such organization, initially called Hanuman Akhara, was formed in 1922 by the Vaidya brothers in Amravati and eventually became the Hanuman Vyayam Prasarak mandal (HVPM). A satellite organization of the HVPM helped to revise the rules for kabaddi in the 1930s after the Indian YMCA had first formulated the rules in earlier years.[17]\n\nAdministration [ edit ]\n\nThe Directorate of Sports and Youth Services (Maharashtra) is the governing body which is responsible for sports in Maharashtra. The directorate is a part of the School Education and Sports Department of the Government of Maharashtra and is let by the Sports and Youth Welfare Minister of Maharashtra.[18]\n\nThe Maharashtra Olympic Association, affiliated with the Indian Olympic Association, is responsible for the selection and participation of the state's contingent in the Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games, Asian Games, and for the South Asian Games in Maharashtra.[19]\n\nThe Maharashtra Cricket Association is the governing body for cricket activities in Maharashtra and for the Maharashtra cricket team. It is affiliated with the Board of Control for Cricket in India.[20][21][22] The Maharashtra Cricket Association is one of three cricket associations based in Maharashtra, along with Mumbai Cricket Association and Vidarbha Cricket Association.[23]\n\nThe Western India Football Association (WIFA) is the governing body for football in Maharashtra, and was established on 12 July 1911. It is affiliated with the All India Football Federation, the sport's national governing body for all of India.[24]\n\nSports policy [ edit ]\n\nThe Maharashtra government announced its first sports policy in 1996, the first Indian state to do so.[25] After five years, in 2001, the state government launched a second sports policy for a ten-year period, which had the motto \"Fitness for all through Sports\". As part of this policy, the Sports Infrastructure Development Plan was created[25] and a reservation was made for a sportsperson in government and semi-government jobs. In 2012, a third sports policy was declared, which created financial assistance to prepare the state for participation in international competitions.[25]\n\nIndigenous sports [ edit ]\n\nIndian sports—include badminton, kabaddi, kho kho, atya patya, langdi, and mallakhamba—originated in or were formalised in Maharashtra.[26][27] In rural areas of Maharashtra, kusti (Indian mud wrestling) and bullock cart competitions can regularly be seen during the annual jatra carnival. The Maharashtran government has supported kusti in the state by constructing two permanent training centers for the sport in the Kolhapur area.[28]\n\nIndian wrestling [ edit ]\n\nA kushti competition at Jawla in Solapur district\n\nDespite cricket's dominance in most of India, wrestling has maintained its popularity in Maharashtra, especially in the rural regions of the state and Kolhapur district.[29] One famous wrestler from the state was Khashaba Jadhav, who won a bronze medal in the 1952 Helsinki Olympics; he was the first citizen from the newly independent nation of India to win an Olympic medal in an individual sport.[29][30]\n\nIn kusti, a style of traditional wrestling, matches are typically held in a clay or dirt pit[31] in which the soil is mixed with ghee and other materials.[32] This sport encompasses an ancient subculture in which wrestlers live and train together and following strict rules on diet and leisure. The focus is on living a pure life and building one's strength and skills, and abstaining from drinking, smoking, and sex.[32] The wrestlers' diets consist of milk, almonds, ghee, eggs, and chapattis.[32] Kusti represents the intersection of sports, politics, and culture and is deeply embedded in the agrarian economy of rural Maharashtra.[33]\n\nAnother style of wrestling popular in Maharashtra is that associated with Hind Kesari, a wrestling championship established in 1958 and affiliated with the All India Amateur Wrestling Federation (AIAWF).[34] Most common in the rural areas of western Maharashtra, wrestlers train in schools called taleems, in which wrestling gurus instruct students on both physical and moral instruction in a style of wrestling that blends spiritual and secular practices.[35] The largest tournaments in the state draw top wrestlers from the region and even outside India, including from Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, and several African nations.[35]\n\nField hockey [ edit ]\n\nHiranna M. Nimal, silver medalist at the 1962 Asian Games\n\nField hockey is one of the most popular sports in Maharashtra. Up to thirty domestic tournaments of the sport are held in a calendar year in Pune alone,[36] such as the All India Bombay Gold Cup Hockey Tournament and the All India Aagha Khan Hockey Tournament.[37][38] The state is home to three hockey clubs playing in different leagues, and was home to a now-defunct club called the Maratha Warriors, who competed in the Premier Hockey League.[39][40][41] The Mumbai Magicians are based in Mumbai and play in the Hockey India League.[42][43] The Mumbai Marines[44][45] and the Pune Strykers play in the World Series Hockey.[46]\n\nMahindra Hockey Stadium serves as the home venue of the Mumbai Marines and Mumbai Magicians, and used to be the home venue of the Maratha Warriors. The stadium hosted the 1982 Men's Hockey World Cup.[37][38] PCMC Hockey Stadium serves as the home venue of the Pune Strykers.[47]\n\nMany individual Maharashtrian have also contributed to India's hockey legacy. Tushar Khandekar is referred to as \"the Goal Poacher\".[29] Hiranna M. Nimal was a silver medalist at the 1962 Asian Games and also represented Maharashtra in many other national and international leagues.[29] Other notable hockey stars from the state include Dhanraj Pillay and Viren Rasquinha.[citation needed]\n\nCricket [ edit ]\n\nPlaying cricket at Oval Maidan, Mumbai\n\nWankhede Stadium during the first innings of the 2011 ICC World Cup Final between Sri Lanka and India\n\nCricket is played at domestic and international levels in Maharashtra and is consistently supported by people from most parts of the state. Maharashtra is home to the Maharashtra cricket team,[48] Vidarbha cricket team,[49] Veer Marathi cricket franchise,[50][51] Mumbai Indians,[52][53] and the regionally dominant Mumbai cricket team.[54] The Mumbai cricket team was the dominant franchise for much of the 20th century, winning the first Ranji Trophy Championship over North India in 1935[55] and winning fifteen consecutive Ranji Trophy victories between 1958–1973.[56] Mumbai is the most successful team in the history of the Ranji Trophy championship, winning 40 titles over the course of its history, as well as the most successful team in the Irani Cup, with 16 titles won.[57][58]\n\nThe Mumbai cricket team is overseen by the Mumbai Cricket Association and the Maharashtra cricket team is overseen by the Maharashtra Cricket Association.[59] The Mumbai cricket team and Mumbai Indians both have their home grounds at Wankhede Stadium, an international cricket ground. Both teams play in the Indian Premier League, of which the Mumbai Indians was one of eight founding members in 2008.[60]\n\nThe Maharashtra Cricket Association set up a T20 franchise league called Maharashtra Premier League (MPL) in 2023, which has six teams. It sold the franchise rights for 57 crore rupees for three years through open bidding. The inaugural season was expected to start on 15 June 2023, at the association's Pune's stadium.\n\nMaharashtra is home to India's first cricket museum, Blades of Glory, which is based in Pune and run by Rohan Pate, a former cricketer. It opened during the 2013 Indian Premier League season.[61][62]\n\nIndia versus Vietnam football match in the Shree Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex\n\nFootball is another popular sport in many parts of the state, with the FIFA World Cup and the English Premier League being followed widely.[63] The Maharashtra Football Pyramid consists of district leagues, each of which are broken into sub-leagues. This pyramid operates during the whole calendar year, but at different times. In the I-League, Mumbai was represented by Mumbai FC,[64] Mahindra United,[65] and Air-India.[66] Pune FC was established in August 2007 and is a recently founded football club in the I-League.[67] There is local rivalry among the Mumbai-based clubs Air India FC and Mumbai FC, and state rivalry with Pune FC. Matches between these teams are called the \"Maha Derby\", as they are played in Maharashtra.[68] Maharashtra is also represented in the Santosh Trophy by the Maharashtra football team, who last won the trophy in the 1999–2000 season.[69][70]\n\nThe Western India Football Association (WIFA) signed a deal with Sporting Ace, a sports management company, to infuse new investments into Maharashtra football. The Mumbai District Football Association (MDFA) is the organisation responsible for association football in and around Mumbai. The MDFA organises around seven leagues that contain more than 300 club sides in total, in addition to being responsible for six of India's I-League sides.[71]\n\nSeven-a-side football is also hugely popular in Maharashtra. The eighth Motilal Mathurawala Trophy Seven-a-side Junior National Football Championship was held in Pune.[72]\n\nMaharashtra has two club franchises which play American football in the Elite Football League of India.[73] The Mumbai Gladiators is a team based in Mumbai[74] and the Pune Marathas is a team based in Pune with the Shree Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex as its home stadium.[75] Maharashtra hosted the First Youth National American Football Championship in 2007[76] in which the Mumbai Gladiators and Pune Marathas played their first match against each other.[73] However, neither team won the championship, which was instead won by the visiting Manipur team.[76]\n\nDerby (horse racing) [ edit ]\n\nThe horse racing season in Maharashtra starts in mid-November and ends in the last week of April. Every February, Mumbai holds derby races at the Mahalaxmi Racecourse.[77] Since 1986, McDowell's Indian Derby has been sponsored by liquor baron Vijay Mallya's UB Group as The McDowell's Indian Derby.\n\nThe Mahalaxmi Racecourse horse racing track is one of two racecourses in Maharashtra. The track is oval with a 2,400 metres (7,900 ft) straight chute spread over approximately 225 acres (0.91 km2; 0.352 sq mi). It was built in 1883[78] and modelled on the Caulfield Racecourse in Melbourne.[79] Pune Race Course is the second racecourse in Maharashtra. It was built in 1830 and covers 118.5 acres (48.0 ha).[80]\n\nGrand Prix [ edit ]\n\nIn March 2004, the Mumbai Grand Prix was part of the F1 powerboat world championship, and the Force India F1 team car was unveiled in Mumbai in 2008.[81] As of 2011, the city plans to build its own F1 track and various sites were assessed, of which the authorities have narrowed down to either Marve-Malad or Panvel-Kalyan. If approved, the track will be clubbed with a theme park and will spread over 400 to 500 acres (162 to 202 ha).[82][needs update]\n\nMarathon [ edit ]\n\nMumbai Marathon [ edit ]\n\nIn 2004, the annual Mumbai Marathon was established as a part of \"The Greatest Race on Earth\". The Mumbai Marathon is an annual international marathon held on the third Sunday of January. The Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon is India's biggest charity platform.[83]\n\nPune Marathon [ edit ]\n\nThe Pune International Marathon is an annual marathon held in Pune; it was established in 1983 and was the first Indian marathon to be certified by the AIMS.[84] The Athletics Federation of India has awarded the status of National Marathon Championship to the Pune International Marathon.[85] Funds raised from the race are donated to Project Concern International, an NGO working towards HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention.[85]\n\nRace types of Pune International Marathon [ 86 ] No Race Name Distance (in kilometers) 1 Men's & Women's Marathon 42.195 2 Men's & Women's Half Marathon 21 3 Women's Half Marathon 21 4 Men's & Women's 10 km 10 5 Men's & Women's 5 km 5 6 Wheelchair (Machine & Hand) 3.5\n\nTennis [ edit ]\n\nATP 250 Maharashtra Open is annually organised in Pune. It is India's only international level tennis tournament, with singles and doubles male players from the country and abroad participating. It is organised by Maharashtra Lawn Tennis Association, which is the governing body of this sport in the state.\n\nMaharashtra has a franchise-based tennis league, the Maharashtra Tennis League (MTL), which is India's first league format in tennis.[87][88][89] The MTL launched with a total of 80 players and five teams: the Mumbai Blasters, Sharp Smashers, Baseline Bombers, Accurate Aces, and Dazzling Deuces.[90][91][92] Each team in the league consists of six players, at least two of which must be women and at least one of which must be from Maharashtra.[93]\n\nOne famous Maharashtrian tennis player was Gaurav Natekar, a former Davis Cup player[94] and seven-time Indian National Tennis Champion. He was awarded the Arjuna Award for Tennis in 1996.[95]\n\nMumbai has hosted the Kingfisher Airlines Tennis Open, an International Series tournament of the ATP World Tour, in 2006 and 2007.[96] The tournaments were played on outdoor hard courts at the Cricket Club of India in Mumbai.[97][98]\n\nChess [ edit ]\n\nRohini Khadilkar (Mumbai) a former women's chess champion of India\n\nMaharashtra has a five-decade-long chess culture.[99] The first chess association in Maharashtra was formed in 1921 and was known as the South Maharashtra Chess Club.[100] The Sangali Chess Society was established in 1930.[100] The Southern Maratha Country Chess Association originated in 1955. With the growth of the game in the state, the first chess body in Mumbai, known as the Bombay Chess Association, was established in 1944. Open chess tournaments started in the city in 1945.[100] Then, in 1950, the All India Chess Federation was started in Mumbai and held tournaments at the national level for five years afterwards in Mumbai. The first Inter-State Championship was held in 1960.[100] In 1963, the Bombay Chess Association and Southern Maratha Country Chess Association merged to form the Maharashtra Chess Association.\n\nThe Maharashtra Chess League, the first-ever IPL style chess league in India, started the PYC Hindu Gymkhana club in Pune on 24 April 2013.[101] The tournament played on a league-cum-knock-out basis. Each team played the other five teams once, with the top four teams at the end of the league stage making it to the semifinals.[101]\n\nMaharashtra has produced many notable chess players, including Abhijit Kunte, Praveen Thipsay, Rohini Khadilkar, and Anupama Gokhale.[citation needed]\n\nSee also [ edit ]",

Earlier this same plot was allotted to cricketer Sunil Gavaskar in 1988 for an indoor cricket centre. But since no work was done on this plot, the government had taken it back in 2022.The current condition of this plot is bad, and the nearby slum dwellers are using it for unnecessary activities.The Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) authority had earlier passed a resolution and recommended giving this plot to Rahane, and the same proposal of MHADA was approved by the state cabinet on Monday.Rahane took to Instagram and thanked the government for the allocation of plot in a story.Since his international debut in 2011, Rahane has represented the country in all three formats of the game, scoring 8,414 runs in 195 matches and 251 innings at an average of 35.95, with 15 centuries and 51 fifties.

        "content": "The Maharashtra government on Thursday informed the Bombay High Court that it has formed a committee that will decide the upcoming awardees in the women's category who will qualify for the Shiv Chhatrapati Rajya Krida Purasakar.\n\nThe committee is being headed by state Sports Minister Dattatre Bharne, and will decide the prestigious sports award by the state government, which is given to one male and one female sports person who performs the best in their field.\n\n\n\nTwo different division benches of Justices Revati Mohite-Dere and Dr Neela Gokhale and Justices GS Kulkarni and Advait Sethna were hearing two different petitions seeking the same recognition from the Maharashtra government.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAdvocate Ketaki Gokhale, who was an artistic gymnast, had approached the court, claiming that during Covid-19 induced pandemic, the Maharashtra government did not give out the sportsman awards, and in January 2023, they called for the applications from sportspersons for past three years, 2020-2023.\n\nPetitioner Gokhale's plea stated that for 2019-2020 and 2020-2021, she was the highest scorer in gymnastics sports. As per the government resolution, the scores are calculated based on the number of medals won at state and national championships. The government resolution also stated that one had to win medals in at least three national championships in the given sports category.\n\nAccording to Gokhale, because of Covid some of the championships were not held by the national federation so no gymnast would fit into the criteria and even though she had high medal tally at the national games, she too was not being considered.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Maharashtra government had allegedly mechanically rejected her application because she had participated in one less gymnastics championship as demanded by the government.\n\nGokhale's contention was that when the championships themselves were not held, then the criteria of winning medals in three minimum national championships cannot be fulfilled by anyone. And because of this, no one was given the award for these three years in gymnastics which was not right.\n\nAnother gymnast, Vaidehi Dewoolkar, who was the other petitioner, had applied for the award for the year 2021-2022 and her contentions were similar to those of Gokhale's.\n\nMeanwhile, gymnast Ganesh Navle had approached the High Court earlier with similar contention, seeking that he be considered for the award for the year 2019-2020 in men's category. In March 2024, the high court had directed the Maharashtra government to consider Navle's application, and in October 2024, the state finally declared that he will be given the award after modifying the criteria.\n\nAdvocates Gaurav Bhavnani and Satish Shukla appearing for the petitioners Gokhale and Deoolkar argued that the government should have applied the modified criteria in Gokhale as well as Deoolkar's case in women category the way they applied the modified criteria for giving the award to Navle in the men's category during the pandemic.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAfter hearing Bhavnani and Shukla, the benches directed the government to consider the same. It is following this direction that the government formed the committee.\n\nAdditional Government Pleader Manish Upadhyaye submitted that the committee will take about three weeks to take a decision.\n\nHe submitted that a week before a public announcement of these awards, if the petitioners are not selected for the award, then they will be intimated so that they can avail any other legal remedy. The bench agreed to this.\n\nPublished By: Vivek Published On: Feb 14, 2025",

        "content": "A computer operator working at a sports complex in Maharashtra is accused of stealing Rs 21 crore. The 23-year-old, Harshal Kumar Kshirsagar, used the stolen money to buy expensive cars, a luxury flat, and gifts for his girlfriend. Harshal worked as a contractual employee at the sports complex in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar.\n\nThe police have arrested two people, Yashoda Shetty and her husband BK Jeevan, for helping Harshal with the crime. The police found out that Harshal used an old letterhead from the sports complex to send an email to the bank. He asked them to change the email address linked to the bank account, using a new email address that was very similar to the original one. This gave him access to the account, including OTPs and other details needed for transactions.\n\nBetween July 1 and December 7, Harshal transferred Rs 21.6 crore into 13 different bank accounts. He spent the stolen money on luxury items, including a BMW car worth Rs 1.2 crore, an SUV for Rs 1.3 crore, and a BMW bike worth Rs 32 lakh. He also bought a 4 BHK flat for his girlfriend near the Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar airport and ordered diamond-studded glasses for her.\n\nThe fraud was discovered when a sports department official noticed unusual financial activity and filed a complaint. Police have seized the luxury cars and are looking for Harshal, who is still on the run. They suspect that more people may be involved in the fraud and are continuing their investigation.\n\nSenior police officer Prashant Kadam said, “Two suspects have been arrested, and we are looking for the main accused, Harshal. The investigation shows that he used the stolen money for luxury items, including cars, an apartment, and gold ornaments.”\n\nThe police are working hard to find Harshal and learn the full details of the crime.",

        "content": "Maharashtra Sports Commissioner seeks 'strict action' against Rajvardhan Hangargekar for age fraud\n\nIt is believed that the pacer had altered his birth date from January 10, 2001, to November 10, 2002, and was thus over-age when he competed in the U-19 World Cup\n\nMaharashtra State Sports Commissioner Omprakash Bakoria has written to the BCCI seeking \"strict action\" against India U-19 World Cup-winning member Rajvardhan Hangargekar for age fraud.\n\nIn a letter dated February 8, Bakoria wrote to BCCI secretary Jay Shah that the pacer had altered his birth date from January 10, 2001, to November 10, 2002, and was thus over-age when he competed in the recently-concluded U-19 World Cup.\n\n\"The conduct of Mr. Rajvardhan Hangangekar is against the sport's integrity and ethics. It deprives fair play and results into damages to the reputation of the nation. Therefore, you are requested to take strict action in accordance with the law,\" Bakoria wrote.\n\nThe letter has also been marked to secretary of Maharashtra Cricket Association Riyaz Bagban. Bakoria further wrote, \"As per the inquiry and the report, it reveals that Mr Rajvardhan Hangargekar has started his academic career at Terna Public School, Osmanabad. It is governed by the school code prescribed by the Government of Maharashtra.\"\n\n\"At the time of admission of Rajvardhan Hangargekar in 1st standard at Terna Public School (primary division) Osmanabad, the date of birth is provided as 10/01/2001. The school record speaks that the birth date of Mr Rajvardhan Hangagekar up to seventh standard is recorded as 10/01/2001.\"\n\nThe commissioner alleged that the school made \"unauthorised corrections\" to Hangargekar's birth date. \"As per the general register maintained by the Terna Public School, Osmanabad, his birth date is 10/01/2001. It appears unauthorised corrections (were) made by the Head Master and his birth date is recorded as 10/11/2002 at the time of fresh application for 8th standard.\"\n\n\"If the headmaster requires any corrections in the birth date, it is necessary to take prior permission of the education officer of the concerned district. However, no such permission has been taken for making changes in the birth date of Mr. Rajvardhan Hangargekar.\n\n\"Therefore said corrections are made in excess of power and amount to cheating and forgery in government records,\" the senior IAS officer stated.\n\nLast week, Hangargekar was bought by Chennai Super Kings for Rs 1.5 crore at the IPL 2022 mega auction. \"On the basis of the fabricated record, Mr Rajvardhan Hangargekar seems to have secured a position in the national team of India. As per the report of Chief Executive Officer (IAS) Zilla Parishad, Osmanabad, the birth date of said player is 10/01/2001 and therefore, he has completed 21 years of age at the time of the tournament.\n\n\"Despite the fact, he has secured a position in the U19 team participating in the ICC (U-19) World Cup 2022.\"\n\nThe PTI tried to contact Maharashtra Cricket Association secretary Bagban and Hangargekar for a response, but both could not be reached. Earlier Manjot Karla, who struck a match-winning century in the final of 2018 U-19 World Cup, was banned for two years from playing for Delhi, for age fraud.\n\nIn September 2011, Maharashtra's Ankit Bawne was removed from India U-19 squad after the date of birth in his passport did not match with the one in his birth certificate and the BCCI records.",

        "content": "Naushad Shaikh, the former Maharashtra captain, emerged as the most sought-after cricketer during the Maharashtra Premier League (MPL) Player Auction, held in Pune on Tuesday.\n\nWhile Shaikh emerged as the most expensive buy with a price tag of Rs. 6 lakh, bought by Punit Balan Group-owned Kolhapur Tuskers, the auction saw six teams combined splurging almost Rs. 1.20 crore during the event.\n\nWith each of the six MPL franchises being allotted an icon player to be bought pre-auction, the teams had a maximum of Rs. 20 lakh at its disposal, with a minimum of 15 players required to be bought.\n\nShaikh’s bidding saw the Tuskers and Puneri Bappa - with Shaikh’s best friend Ruturaj Gaikwad as its icon player - being involved in a tug-of-war until the Pune franchise pulled out after he had hit a figure 10 times more than his base price of Rs. 60,000.\n\nThe auction saw non-icon players being divided into three categories. The base price for each category was Rs. 60,000, Rs. 40,000 and Rs. 20,000, with those having played Ranji Trophy or senior limited overs’ cricket being in the top bracket.\n\nWhile the Tuskers also got hold of Maharashtra’s Ranji captain Ankeet Bawane (Rs. 2.80 lakh) thus making it a fearsome batting line-up, all-rounder Divyang Hinganekar was the second-most expensive player. Hinganekar was signed by Ratnagiri Jets for Rs. 4.60 lakh. The franchise also had regional superstar Nikhil Naik on its roster, who fetched Rs. 3.60 lakh.\n\nLeg-spinner Prashant Solanki, a member of Chennai Super Kings’ triumphant Indian Premier League campaign who has recently moved to Maharashtra from his alma mater Mumbai, was acquired by Rahul Tripathi-led Eagle Nashik Titans for Rs. 2.40 lakh.\n\nThe tournament will be played at the Maharashtra Cricket Association’s International Stadium at Gahunje, on the outskirts of Pune, from June 15. The tournament will also witness three women’s exhibition matches.\n\nTop picks: Naushad Shaikh (Kolhapur Tuskers) Rs. 6 lakh; Divyang Hinganekar (Ratnagiri Jets) Rs. 4.60 lakh; Yash Nahar (Solapur Royals) Rs. 3.80 lakh; Sahil Autade (Kolhapur Tuskers) Rs. 3.80 lakh; Satyajeet Bachhav (Solapur Royals) Rs. 3.60 lakh; Nikhil Naik (Ratnagiri Jets) Rs. 3.40 lakh.\n\nIcon players (fees yet to be disclosed)\n\nPuneri Bappa (Owner: Pravin Masalewale): Ruturaj Gaikwad\n\nKolhapur Tuskers (Punit Balan Group): Kedar Jadhav\n\nEagle Nashik Titans (Eagle Infra India Ltd.): Rahul Tripathi\n\nChhatrapati Sambhaji Kings (Venkateshwara Industries): Rajvardhan Hangargekar\n\nRatnagiri Jets (Jets Synthesis): Azim Kazi\n\nSolapur Royals (Kapil Sons Explosive LLP): Vicky Ostwal",

He's due to face a departmental inquiry.\n\nThe police department in Pune's Pimpri Chinchwad area, under which Mr Zende works, told BBC Marathi that he was suspended for playing the game without permission and for giving media interviews in his uniform.\n\nMr Zende, however, said he was being treated \"unfairly\".\n\nThe police official said he began playing games on Dream 11 last month. On 10 October, he won the 15m-rupee prize money after winning a game on the platform.\n\nDream 11 calls itself a \"game of skill\" and cites a 2021 Supreme Court ruling on its website to say that its platform is exempt from the country's gambling law.\n\nGambling is illegal in India but some in the gaming industry argue that the practice is different from \"online skill-based gaming\", where the element of skill outweighs the element of chance.\n\nThe app has popular cricketer MS Dhoni as its ambassador and has featured Bollywood actors like Aamir Khan in its promos.\n\nIt lets fans over the age of 18 play sports like cricket, hockey, football and basketball online.

They then earn points based on the performances of these players in actual matches.\n\nMr Zende won while playing the game during a match between Bangladesh and England in the ongoing Cricket World Cup in India.\n\nFollowing his win, reports say Mr Zende was seen wearing his police uniform as he gave interviews to the media.\n\nAmold Thorat, a worker of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is also in power in Maharashtra, wrote to the chief minister and his deputy, demanding action Mr Zende for engaging in \"betting\".\n\nMr Thorat accused Mr Zende of playing the game while on duty and called it a \"dereliction of duty\".\n\nPhotos of Zende in his police uniform had gone viral online and sent the \"wrong message about the state's police force\", he said in his complaint.\n\nMr Zende, however, told BBC Marathi he did not play the game while on duty. He also alleged that he was not the only police official to play the game.\n\n\"Many people play this game. It's a sport. They play for hours,\" he said. \"It's not a gambling game but still I'm being punished.\"\n\nMr Zende said he planned to use his winnings to pay off a housing loan and start fixed deposit accounts in the name of his children.\n\nAt his departmental inquiry, Mr Zende will be allowed to present his case. A senior police official said the department would decide on a future course of action after the inquiry committee submits its report.\n\nBBC News India is now on YouTube. Click here",

        "content": "Mumbai News: IPS Officer Earns Shiv Chhatrapati Maharashtra Sports Award |\n\nMumbai: In a notable recognition of his passion and dedication to adventure sports, IPS Krishna Prakash, the Chief of Force One, Maharashtra, has been awarded the Shiv Chhatrapati Maharashtra Sports Award by the Government of Maharashtra. This marks the first time an IPS officer has been honored in adventure sports. The award ceremony took place at Balewadi Stadium in Pune, where Governor Ramesh Bais and Chief Minister Eknath Shinde presented the accolade.\n\nPrakash’s love of adventure sports has earned him the nickname ‘Ironman’ of the police department. A dedicated fitness enthusiast, he actively participates in challenging triathlon events at national and international levels. One of Prakash’s standout achievements involves being the first person to ever swim from Gateway of India to Elephanta Caves. Diverging from the usual course where swimmers benefit from the tide, he chose to swim against the current and set a record by covering a distance of 16.2km in just five hours and 26 minutes. His expedition was dedicated to raising awareness about preventing drowning incidents.\n\nLet us know! 👂\n\nWhat type of content would you like to see from us this year? — HubSpot (@HubSpot)\n\nRecognised By World Book of Records\n\nKrishna Prakash’s accomplishments have secured him a place in the World Book of Records as the first Indian Government Servant, Civil Servant, and Uniformed Services Officer, including Armed Forces and Para Military Forces, to attain the Ironman title. In 2017, he completed the Ironman Triathlon, renowned as one of the world’s most challenging single-day sporting events. Participants in this grueling event must swim 3.8km, bike 180.2km, and run 42.2km within a strict 16 to 17-hour time frame.Regarding his achievements, the officer shared, “Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is my role model when it comes to tactical matters, administration, and guerrilla tactics. When I heard the news about this award, my first thought was that my dream had come true. This is the highest honor in Maharashtra, and its recognition of sporting activities by the Government. It’s very encouraging.”\n\nHe went on to mention his late discovery of this passion for sports was inspired by senior officer K Vijay Kumar, who led Operation Cocoon and captured the dreaded Veerappan, and registered for the Ironman Sporting event after meeting him while he was in Mumbai for a book release. “I practiced for two years. Initially, it was challenging, but within six months, I participated in the Ironman event in France and succeeded in my very first attempt.”\n\nPrakash stressed, “If you have a passion, your mind becomes strong, and you can achieve anything. I dedicate my weekends and nights to practice.”\n\nKrishna Prakash's Achievements:\n\n2017 - Ironman Title\n\n2018 - Ultra Man Title\n\n2019 - Eye-catching performance in the Race Across West America competition\n\n2020 - Completed the Virtual Comrades race\n\n2021 - Tata Ultra Marathon winner\n\n2023 - Won a Bronze medal in the 90 Km Ultra Run (10 hours 13 minutes)",

        "content": "The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has been in consultation with the state government of Maharashtra to keep Pakistan away from playing in Mumbai and Nagpur during the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 to be held in India.\n\nTop officials in BCCI fear that right-wing party Shiv Sena might cause trouble in relation to law and order in Maharashtra on account of Pakistan playing matches in the state, a report published in The Indian Express said.\n\nMaharashtra’s two Test venues, one in Nagpur and the other in Mumbai, were selected to host the T20 matches, along with Kolkata, Dharamsala, Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi and Mohali.\n\n“BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur spoke to government bodies in Maharashtra and they have advised us to not have any Pakistan games as political parties might create some protest and there could be law and order situation in the state. We don’t know what the situation will be between both countries by next year but we don’t want to take any risk,” a top BCCI official told The Indian Express.\n\nRead: Shiv Sena pressure forces Patna to bench Pakistani players\n\nThakur is a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Member of Parliament. The BJP, often labelled as a “Hindu revivalist” party, is also in power in Maharashtra.\n\nShiv Sena has always taken an extreme stand against the participation of Pakistani players in games hosted in the state of Maharashtra, where it enjoys sizeable support as compared to the rest of India.\n\nEarlier in July, it protested against the participation of Pakistan’s kabaddi players in league matches. As a result, the two Pakistani players — who signed up to play a professional kabbadi league in India — were benched from the matches being held in Mumbai and Pune.\n\nLast year too, three Pakistani kabaddi players participating in the inaugural season of the league were kept away from matches in the state by their teams on account of the threat against them.\n\nRead: Atif Aslam's concert in India cancelled after Shiv Sena threat\n\nThe International Cricket Council (ICC) has not yet announced the final draws for the World T20, but The Indian Express said in its report that India might play with Pakistan and West Indies in the same group.\n\nIn case of an India-Pakistan encounter, Chennai or Mohali would most likely be the host, the report said.\n\n“We will ensure that Pakistan will not have to play any games in Mumbai or Nagpur. As the World T20 final is scheduled to take place at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata, there won't be any problems in Bengal,” the report quoted BCCI sources as saying.",

        "content": "M A I N N E W S BCCI suspends Kale, orders probe Kolkata, November 21\n\nRocked by unprecedented charges of bribery, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) moved in quickly today and suspended first class cricketer Abhijit Kale for allegedly offering Rs 10 lakh each to two national selectors for a place in the Indian team to Australia and ordered an inquiry into it. The board appointed Chairman of the Bar Council of India D.V. Subba Rao as the Commissioner of Inquiry who has been asked to submit his findings within 15 days. Announcing this, BCCI President Jagmohan Dalmiya said the inquiry report would be referred to the boards disciplinary committee for final adjudication and till that time Kale would remain suspended from participating in any tournament conducted by the board. Kale, who has denied the charge, has also been asked by the Maharashtra Cricket Association to appear before a three-member inquiry committee in Pune tomorrow. The BCCI chief, who read out written reports given to him by two selectors  Pranab Roy of East Zone and Kiran More of West Zone  whom he had allegedly approached, clarified that Kale had offered monetary inducements for his selection in the Australia-bound Indian team. The bribery controversy, the biggest to hit Indian cricket since the match-fixing scandal more than two years ago, came to light during the TVS Cup final between India and Australia on Tuesday when the two selectors verbally informed Dalmiya about Kales alleged offer. I told them to give everything in writing as this was a serious matter and had legal ramifications, Dalmiya said, adding that the actions announced today were as per the advice of boards legal counsel. Dalmiya said on November 19, he had conveyed the matter to the Maharashtra Cricket Association, to which Kale belonged and whose representatives were in the city for the tri-series final. The written reports from the two national selectors, he said, were received by him late last night and referred them to the legal counsel. In his report, Roy said I was approached by Abhijit Kale with an offer of monetary inducement of Rs 10 lakh for a place in the Indian team. I reprimanded him for his audacity and misdemeanour and he apologised, Roy said in the report, according to Dalmiya. In a separate report, More said Kale repeatedly called me over phone and tried to offer money to get selected. The manner in which he approached me is unethical and might have spoilt the image of the game in the country, More said in his report. None of the selectors, however, mentioned when they were offered these inducements, but both of them indicated that Kale called them on more than one occasion to impress upon them for a place in the Indian team. Apparently, the offers were made before November 13, when the national selectors met in Bangalore to choose 20 probables for the Australian trip. The final 16 were selected at Hyderabad two days later. The punitive action taken by the board has been conveyed to Kale and to all affiliated units of the board, including the Maharashtra Cricket Association. Asked whether Mores letter had specified the amount allegedly offered by Kale, Dalmiya said these details you will know once the inquiry is held. I have acted as per prima facie evidence ... on the basis of whatever information I had. The commissioner of inquiry asked me to initiate the process quickly as applying the principle of natural justice is important, Dalmiya said.  PTI",

        "content": "Sport as a driver for social and economic development\n\nOnce upon a time, most sports were for boys or men, and for those who could afford them. Yet today sport has proven to be much more than just a source of entertainment for a select few.\n\nIts potential to empower people of all ages, to enable physical, mental, and emotional well-being, and to develop values such as motivation, consistency, and teamwork, has led it to be recognized as an effective tool for promoting peace and progress by the United Nations.\n\nIn January of this year, ARaymond India teamed up with the Bovelander foundation, a non-profit organization that implements hockey programs in underprivileged areas around the world, to launch the Maharashtra Grassroots Hockey Program. The Maharashtra Grassroots Hockey Program, designed and run by the Bovelander Foundation, with Dutch Olympic Gold medalist and World hockey champion Floris Jan Bovelander at its head, will teach hockey to 3 000 students from 50 schools in the Maharashtra area by 2025.\n\nARaymond India is the first company in the area to partake in this project. As Ranjana Gaikwad, Senior CSR Manager of ARaymond India says, “we hope to inspire other companies to participate in this program. The more we are in supporting this type of program, the more progress we make, it’s that simple.” ARaymond India is financially supporting the project by funding each child’s equipment, the coach’s fees, and the festivities that will be organized each year.\n\nGaikwad goes on to explain, “when we recruit children for this program, we pay particular attention to guaranteeing a fair split between boys and girls and we pay no attention at all to cast, religion, or background. We see only the child and her or his potential for growth and joy. And we don’t only get the children involved. We invite the parents to learn the health and hygiene principles taught and to embark on this journey of development with their children.”\n\nAnd because progress achieved deserves to be celebrated, next January a competition and a festivity for all the participants will be held. Rewarding efforts and having a good time all together is also part of the process!\n\nGaikwad concludes, “we’re enjoying every step of this adventure, and looking forward to seeing the children, parents, our communities, and ourselves, grow all together. It’s our responsibility to lead by example and to engage with levers like sport that can help our less privileged communities to progress from the ground up.”\n\nBy Mara Saviotti\n\nCommunications and Press Relations",
