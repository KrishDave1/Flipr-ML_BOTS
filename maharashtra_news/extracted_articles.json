I am speaking on behalf of all his students. His life revolved around cricket in Shivaji Park. Being at Shivaji Park forever is what he would have wished for.I am very happy with the government’s decision to build a statue for Achrekar Sir at his karmabhoomi,\" Tendulkar posted on X (formerly Twitter).The announcement was made on Wednesday, a day ahead of the National Sports Day, which is also the birth anniversary of hockey legend Major Dhyan Chand.The Government of Maharashtra on Wednesday issued a Government Resolution (GR) permitting the installation of the monument in memory of the famous cricket coach who mentored Tendulkar and several other India players during their formative years at the famed Shivaji Park on an open space near gate No. 5.The idea to build a memorial for Achrekar at the Shivaji Park was initiated, and continuously followed up by one of Achrekar's students, Sunil Ramachandran, who is the former captain of the Kamat Memorial Cricket Club and is presently the assistant general secretary of the Shivaji Park Gymkhana.\"It was possible because of the guidance and support of (MNS chief) Raj Thackeray,\" Ramachandran, told TOI.A winner of the prestigious Dronacharya award, Achrekar, who passed away on January 2, 2019, at the age of 87, mentored 14 players who went on to play for India.

It deprives fair play and results into damages to the reputation of the nation. Therefore, you are requested to take strict action in accordance with the law,” Bakoria wrote.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe letter has also been marked to secretary of Maharashtra Cricket Association Riyaz Bagban.\n\nBakoria further wrote, “As per the inquiry and the report, it reveals that Mr Rajvardhan Hangargekar has started his academic career from Terna Public School, Osmanabad. It is governed by the school code prescribed by the Government of Maharashtra.” “At the time of admission of Rajvardhan Hangargekar in 1st standard at Terna Public School (primary division) Osmanabad, the date of birth is provided as 10/01/2001. The school record speaks that the birth date of Mr Rajvardhan Hangagekar up to seventh standard is recorded as 10/01/2001.” The commissioner alleged that the school made “unauthorised corrections” to Hangargekar’s birth date.\n\n“As per the general register maintained by the Terna Public School, Osmanabad, his birth date is 10/01/2001. It appears unauthorised corrections (were) made by the Head Master and his birth date is recorded as 10/11/2002 at the time of fresh application for 8th standard.” “If the headmaster requires any corrections in the birth date, it is necessary to take prior permission of the education officer of the concerned district. However, no such permission has been taken for making changes in the birth date of Mr Rajvardhan Hangargekar.\n\n“Therefore said corrections are made in excess of power and amount to cheating and forgery in government records,” the senior IAS officer stated.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nLast week, Hangargekar was bought by Chennai Super Kings for Rs 1.5 crore at the IPL 2022 mega auction.\n\n“On the basis of the fabricated record, Mr Rajvardhan Hangargekar seems to have secured a position in the national team of India. As per the report of Chief Executive Officer (IAS) Zilla Parishad, Osmanabad, the birth date of said player is 10/01/2001 and therefore, he has completed 21 years of age at the time of the tournament.\n\n“Despite of the fact, he has secured a position in the U19 team participating in the ICC (U-19) World Cup 2022.” The PTI tried to contact Maharashtra Cricket Association secretary Bagban and Hangargekar for a response, but both could not be reached.\n\nEarlier Manjot Karla, who struck a match-winning century in the final of 2018 U-19 World Cup, was banned for two years from playing for Delhi, for age fraud.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nIn September 2011, Maharashtra’s Ankit Bawne was removed from India U-19 squad after the date of birth in his passport did not match with the one in his birth certificate and the BCCI records.",

        "content": "Overview of situation of sport in Indian state, Maharashtra\n\nSports play an integral part of culture in the Indian state of Maharashtra. Cricket is the most popular spectator sport in the state. Other popular sports include kabaddi and kho kho, which are played in rural areas, and field hockey, badminton, and table tennis, which are more common in urban areas, schools, and colleges. In the state's southern rural regions, annual wrestling championships such as Hind Kesari and Maharashtra Kesari are held. Games like Viti-Dandu and variations of Tag are played among children.\n\nThe Mumbai cricket team represents Mumbai, Palghar, and Thane districts in Indian domestic cricket, whilst the Maharashtra cricket team represents the rest of the state. Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) governs cricket in the state except for the Mumbai region. The state is home to international standard stadiums including Wankhede stadium in Mumbai and Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune. In the Indian Premier League (IPL), the Mumbai Indians franchise represents the state from Mumbai; the women's team plays in the Women's Premier League. The Maharashtra Open, a tennis ATP Tour 250 tournament, is annually held in Balewadi Stadium, Pune.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nPre-colonial sports [ edit ]\n\nIn ancient India, a martial art called mallavidya was practiced. It was a form of grappling that was more complex than wrestling, and was performed in earthen mud pits called akhadas or talims, some of which can still be found in Maharashtra today. Historical depictions of the martial art can be seen on archaeological sculptures from the region at numerous locations, such as Kharosa or Pavnar.[1]\n\nBaji Rao II, the last Peshwa of the Maratha Empire, was a patron of strength and wrestling competitions during the early 19th century. Under his patronage, the sport of malkhamb (pole gymnastics) was developed in Pune by Balambhat Deodhar. After Baji Rao lost power and was exiled to northern India, Deodhar brought malkhamb and mallavidya to other Maratha-ruled states such as Baroda and Gwalior. In the later 19th and early 20th centuries, other rulers such as those of Kolhapur and Aundh were also patrons of organised wrestling and sporting festivals.[2] Among the rulers of these princely states, horse riding, wrestling, fencing, archery, and shooting gained popularity.[3]\n\nImported sports under British rule [ edit ]\n\nBritish rule in India drastically changed the landscape of sports in Maharastra. Like in other regions of India, British rulers and aristocrats enjoyed outdoor sports and built facilities for their own leisure.[4] This led to the introduction of several British sports, including cricket, and the development of the new game of badminton.[5] New infrastructure—such as the building of a dam at Bund Garden in 1860—allowed for recreational boating on the Mula-Mutha river.[6] In addition, the colonial rulers introduced horse racing; some racecourses built during this period, such as the Mahalaxmi Racecourse and Pune Race Course, are still in operation today.[7][8]\n\nBy the late 19th century, the British had constructed numerous sports clubs that were exclusively white or restricted based on religion, such as Poona Europeans, Poona Parsees, and Poona Hindu Gymkhana. While many of the religion-based clubs were dominated by educated Brahmins, there were also some lower-caste sports stars such as the brothers Palwankar Baloo and Vithal Palwankar, who played cricket in the early 20th century.[7][8]\n\nIndigenous sports under British rule [ edit ]\n\nAt the same time that imported sports were being developed by the British, indigenous sports continued to change and develop. However, after Indian Civil Service officer Walter Rand was assassinated in 1897 by the Chapekar brothers who ran a wrestling venue in Pune, British colonial authorities viewed these indigenous sports venues with suspicion.[9] A committee was established in 1914 in order to set rules for kho-kho.[10] The formalization of Indian sports continued in the region, and the Deccan Gymkhana sports club was instrumental in organizing the first Indian delegation to an Olympic games, which participated in the 1920 games in Antwerp.[11] Other clubs, such as the Maharashtra Mandal club, which formed in the early 20th century, promoted physical culture and education by hosting both indigenous and Western sports.[9][12]\n\nOther indigenous sports and exercises developed as well, especially yoga. In the 1920s, Bhawanrao Shriniwasrao Pant Pratinidhi, the ruler of Aundh State, helped popularize the series of yoga positions called Surya Namaskar, a flowing sequence of salutations to the sun. This series contained popular asanas (positions) such as upward and downward dog and Uttanasana which helped to popularize yoga as exercise.[13]\n\nBeginning in the 1910s, local Indian organizations were established in order to propagate and develop Indian physical culture. One such organization, initially called Hanuman Akhara, was formed in 1922 by the Vaidya brothers in Amravati and eventually became the Hanuman Vyayam Prasarak mandal (HVPM). A satellite organization of the HVPM helped to revise the rules for kabaddi in the 1930s after the Indian YMCA had first formulated the rules in earlier years.[17]\n\nAdministration [ edit ]\n\nThe Directorate of Sports and Youth Services (Maharashtra) is the governing body which is responsible for sports in Maharashtra. The directorate is a part of the School Education and Sports Department of the Government of Maharashtra and is let by the Sports and Youth Welfare Minister of Maharashtra.[18]\n\nThe Maharashtra Olympic Association, affiliated with the Indian Olympic Association, is responsible for the selection and participation of the state's contingent in the Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games, Asian Games, and for the South Asian Games in Maharashtra.[19]\n\nThe Maharashtra Cricket Association is the governing body for cricket activities in Maharashtra and for the Maharashtra cricket team. It is affiliated with the Board of Control for Cricket in India.[20][21][22] The Maharashtra Cricket Association is one of three cricket associations based in Maharashtra, along with Mumbai Cricket Association and Vidarbha Cricket Association.[23]\n\nThe Western India Football Association (WIFA) is the governing body for football in Maharashtra, and was established on 12 July 1911. It is affiliated with the All India Football Federation, the sport's national governing body for all of India.[24]\n\nSports policy [ edit ]\n\nThe Maharashtra government announced its first sports policy in 1996, the first Indian state to do so.[25] After five years, in 2001, the state government launched a second sports policy for a ten-year period, which had the motto \"Fitness for all through Sports\". As part of this policy, the Sports Infrastructure Development Plan was created[25] and a reservation was made for a sportsperson in government and semi-government jobs. In 2012, a third sports policy was declared, which created financial assistance to prepare the state for participation in international competitions.[25]\n\nIndigenous sports [ edit ]\n\nIndian sports—include badminton, kabaddi, kho kho, atya patya, langdi, and mallakhamba—originated in or were formalised in Maharashtra.[26][27] In rural areas of Maharashtra, kusti (Indian mud wrestling) and bullock cart competitions can regularly be seen during the annual jatra carnival. The Maharashtran government has supported kusti in the state by constructing two permanent training centers for the sport in the Kolhapur area.[28]\n\nIndian wrestling [ edit ]\n\nA kushti competition at Jawla in Solapur district\n\nDespite cricket's dominance in most of India, wrestling has maintained its popularity in Maharashtra, especially in the rural regions of the state and Kolhapur district.[29] One famous wrestler from the state was Khashaba Jadhav, who won a bronze medal in the 1952 Helsinki Olympics; he was the first citizen from the newly independent nation of India to win an Olympic medal in an individual sport.[29][30]\n\nIn kusti, a style of traditional wrestling, matches are typically held in a clay or dirt pit[31] in which the soil is mixed with ghee and other materials.[32] This sport encompasses an ancient subculture in which wrestlers live and train together and following strict rules on diet and leisure. The focus is on living a pure life and building one's strength and skills, and abstaining from drinking, smoking, and sex.[32] The wrestlers' diets consist of milk, almonds, ghee, eggs, and chapattis.[32] Kusti represents the intersection of sports, politics, and culture and is deeply embedded in the agrarian economy of rural Maharashtra.[33]\n\nAnother style of wrestling popular in Maharashtra is that associated with Hind Kesari, a wrestling championship established in 1958 and affiliated with the All India Amateur Wrestling Federation (AIAWF).[34] Most common in the rural areas of western Maharashtra, wrestlers train in schools called taleems, in which wrestling gurus instruct students on both physical and moral instruction in a style of wrestling that blends spiritual and secular practices.[35] The largest tournaments in the state draw top wrestlers from the region and even outside India, including from Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, and several African nations.[35]\n\nField hockey [ edit ]\n\nHiranna M. Nimal, silver medalist at the 1962 Asian Games\n\nField hockey is one of the most popular sports in Maharashtra. Up to thirty domestic tournaments of the sport are held in a calendar year in Pune alone,[36] such as the All India Bombay Gold Cup Hockey Tournament and the All India Aagha Khan Hockey Tournament.[37][38] The state is home to three hockey clubs playing in different leagues, and was home to a now-defunct club called the Maratha Warriors, who competed in the Premier Hockey League.[39][40][41] The Mumbai Magicians are based in Mumbai and play in the Hockey India League.[42][43] The Mumbai Marines[44][45] and the Pune Strykers play in the World Series Hockey.[46]\n\nMahindra Hockey Stadium serves as the home venue of the Mumbai Marines and Mumbai Magicians, and used to be the home venue of the Maratha Warriors. The stadium hosted the 1982 Men's Hockey World Cup.[37][38] PCMC Hockey Stadium serves as the home venue of the Pune Strykers.[47]\n\nMany individual Maharashtrian have also contributed to India's hockey legacy. Tushar Khandekar is referred to as \"the Goal Poacher\".[29] Hiranna M. Nimal was a silver medalist at the 1962 Asian Games and also represented Maharashtra in many other national and international leagues.[29] Other notable hockey stars from the state include Dhanraj Pillay and Viren Rasquinha.[citation needed]\n\nCricket [ edit ]\n\nPlaying cricket at Oval Maidan, Mumbai\n\nWankhede Stadium during the first innings of the 2011 ICC World Cup Final between Sri Lanka and India\n\nCricket is played at domestic and international levels in Maharashtra and is consistently supported by people from most parts of the state. Maharashtra is home to the Maharashtra cricket team,[48] Vidarbha cricket team,[49] Veer Marathi cricket franchise,[50][51] Mumbai Indians,[52][53] and the regionally dominant Mumbai cricket team.[54] The Mumbai cricket team was the dominant franchise for much of the 20th century, winning the first Ranji Trophy Championship over North India in 1935[55] and winning fifteen consecutive Ranji Trophy victories between 1958–1973.[56] Mumbai is the most successful team in the history of the Ranji Trophy championship, winning 40 titles over the course of its history, as well as the most successful team in the Irani Cup, with 16 titles won.[57][58]\n\nThe Mumbai cricket team is overseen by the Mumbai Cricket Association and the Maharashtra cricket team is overseen by the Maharashtra Cricket Association.[59] The Mumbai cricket team and Mumbai Indians both have their home grounds at Wankhede Stadium, an international cricket ground. Both teams play in the Indian Premier League, of which the Mumbai Indians was one of eight founding members in 2008.[60]\n\nThe Maharashtra Cricket Association set up a T20 franchise league called Maharashtra Premier League (MPL) in 2023, which has six teams. It sold the franchise rights for 57 crore rupees for three years through open bidding. The inaugural season was expected to start on 15 June 2023, at the association's Pune's stadium.\n\nMaharashtra is home to India's first cricket museum, Blades of Glory, which is based in Pune and run by Rohan Pate, a former cricketer. It opened during the 2013 Indian Premier League season.[61][62]\n\nIndia versus Vietnam football match in the Shree Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex\n\nFootball is another popular sport in many parts of the state, with the FIFA World Cup and the English Premier League being followed widely.[63] The Maharashtra Football Pyramid consists of district leagues, each of which are broken into sub-leagues. This pyramid operates during the whole calendar year, but at different times. In the I-League, Mumbai was represented by Mumbai FC,[64] Mahindra United,[65] and Air-India.[66] Pune FC was established in August 2007 and is a recently founded football club in the I-League.[67] There is local rivalry among the Mumbai-based clubs Air India FC and Mumbai FC, and state rivalry with Pune FC. Matches between these teams are called the \"Maha Derby\", as they are played in Maharashtra.[68] Maharashtra is also represented in the Santosh Trophy by the Maharashtra football team, who last won the trophy in the 1999–2000 season.[69][70]\n\nThe Western India Football Association (WIFA) signed a deal with Sporting Ace, a sports management company, to infuse new investments into Maharashtra football. The Mumbai District Football Association (MDFA) is the organisation responsible for association football in and around Mumbai. The MDFA organises around seven leagues that contain more than 300 club sides in total, in addition to being responsible for six of India's I-League sides.[71]\n\nSeven-a-side football is also hugely popular in Maharashtra. The eighth Motilal Mathurawala Trophy Seven-a-side Junior National Football Championship was held in Pune.[72]\n\nMaharashtra has two club franchises which play American football in the Elite Football League of India.[73] The Mumbai Gladiators is a team based in Mumbai[74] and the Pune Marathas is a team based in Pune with the Shree Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex as its home stadium.[75] Maharashtra hosted the First Youth National American Football Championship in 2007[76] in which the Mumbai Gladiators and Pune Marathas played their first match against each other.[73] However, neither team won the championship, which was instead won by the visiting Manipur team.[76]\n\nDerby (horse racing) [ edit ]\n\nThe horse racing season in Maharashtra starts in mid-November and ends in the last week of April. Every February, Mumbai holds derby races at the Mahalaxmi Racecourse.[77] Since 1986, McDowell's Indian Derby has been sponsored by liquor baron Vijay Mallya's UB Group as The McDowell's Indian Derby.\n\nThe Mahalaxmi Racecourse horse racing track is one of two racecourses in Maharashtra. The track is oval with a 2,400 metres (7,900 ft) straight chute spread over approximately 225 acres (0.91 km2; 0.352 sq mi). It was built in 1883[78] and modelled on the Caulfield Racecourse in Melbourne.[79] Pune Race Course is the second racecourse in Maharashtra. It was built in 1830 and covers 118.5 acres (48.0 ha).[80]\n\nGrand Prix [ edit ]\n\nIn March 2004, the Mumbai Grand Prix was part of the F1 powerboat world championship, and the Force India F1 team car was unveiled in Mumbai in 2008.[81] As of 2011, the city plans to build its own F1 track and various sites were assessed, of which the authorities have narrowed down to either Marve-Malad or Panvel-Kalyan. If approved, the track will be clubbed with a theme park and will spread over 400 to 500 acres (162 to 202 ha).[82][needs update]\n\nMarathon [ edit ]\n\nMumbai Marathon [ edit ]\n\nIn 2004, the annual Mumbai Marathon was established as a part of \"The Greatest Race on Earth\". The Mumbai Marathon is an annual international marathon held on the third Sunday of January. The Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon is India's biggest charity platform.[83]\n\nPune Marathon [ edit ]\n\nThe Pune International Marathon is an annual marathon held in Pune; it was established in 1983 and was the first Indian marathon to be certified by the AIMS.[84] The Athletics Federation of India has awarded the status of National Marathon Championship to the Pune International Marathon.[85] Funds raised from the race are donated to Project Concern International, an NGO working towards HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention.[85]\n\nRace types of Pune International Marathon [ 86 ] No Race Name Distance (in kilometers) 1 Men's & Women's Marathon 42.195 2 Men's & Women's Half Marathon 21 3 Women's Half Marathon 21 4 Men's & Women's 10 km 10 5 Men's & Women's 5 km 5 6 Wheelchair (Machine & Hand) 3.5\n\nTennis [ edit ]\n\nATP 250 Maharashtra Open is annually organised in Pune. It is India's only international level tennis tournament, with singles and doubles male players from the country and abroad participating. It is organised by Maharashtra Lawn Tennis Association, which is the governing body of this sport in the state.\n\nMaharashtra has a franchise-based tennis league, the Maharashtra Tennis League (MTL), which is India's first league format in tennis.[87][88][89] The MTL launched with a total of 80 players and five teams: the Mumbai Blasters, Sharp Smashers, Baseline Bombers, Accurate Aces, and Dazzling Deuces.[90][91][92] Each team in the league consists of six players, at least two of which must be women and at least one of which must be from Maharashtra.[93]\n\nOne famous Maharashtrian tennis player was Gaurav Natekar, a former Davis Cup player[94] and seven-time Indian National Tennis Champion. He was awarded the Arjuna Award for Tennis in 1996.[95]\n\nMumbai has hosted the Kingfisher Airlines Tennis Open, an International Series tournament of the ATP World Tour, in 2006 and 2007.[96] The tournaments were played on outdoor hard courts at the Cricket Club of India in Mumbai.[97][98]\n\nChess [ edit ]\n\nRohini Khadilkar (Mumbai) a former women's chess champion of India\n\nMaharashtra has a five-decade-long chess culture.[99] The first chess association in Maharashtra was formed in 1921 and was known as the South Maharashtra Chess Club.[100] The Sangali Chess Society was established in 1930.[100] The Southern Maratha Country Chess Association originated in 1955.

        "content": "The Maharashtra government on Thursday informed the Bombay High Court that it has formed a committee that will decide the upcoming awardees in the women's category who will qualify for the Shiv Chhatrapati Rajya Krida Purasakar.\n\nThe committee is being headed by state Sports Minister Dattatre Bharne, and will decide the prestigious sports award by the state government, which is given to one male and one female sports person who performs the best in their field.\n\n\n\nTwo different division benches of Justices Revati Mohite-Dere and Dr Neela Gokhale and Justices GS Kulkarni and Advait Sethna were hearing two different petitions seeking the same recognition from the Maharashtra government.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAdvocate Ketaki Gokhale, who was an artistic gymnast, had approached the court, claiming that during Covid-19 induced pandemic, the Maharashtra government did not give out the sportsman awards, and in January 2023, they called for the applications from sportspersons for past three years, 2020-2023.\n\nPetitioner Gokhale's plea stated that for 2019-2020 and 2020-2021, she was the highest scorer in gymnastics sports. As per the government resolution, the scores are calculated based on the number of medals won at state and national championships. The government resolution also stated that one had to win medals in at least three national championships in the given sports category.\n\nAccording to Gokhale, because of Covid some of the championships were not held by the national federation so no gymnast would fit into the criteria and even though she had high medal tally at the national games, she too was not being considered.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Maharashtra government had allegedly mechanically rejected her application because she had participated in one less gymnastics championship as demanded by the government.\n\nGokhale's contention was that when the championships themselves were not held, then the criteria of winning medals in three minimum national championships cannot be fulfilled by anyone. And because of this, no one was given the award for these three years in gymnastics which was not right.\n\nAnother gymnast, Vaidehi Dewoolkar, who was the other petitioner, had applied for the award for the year 2021-2022 and her contentions were similar to those of Gokhale's.\n\nMeanwhile, gymnast Ganesh Navle had approached the High Court earlier with similar contention, seeking that he be considered for the award for the year 2019-2020 in men's category. In March 2024, the high court had directed the Maharashtra government to consider Navle's application, and in October 2024, the state finally declared that he will be given the award after modifying the criteria.\n\nAdvocates Gaurav Bhavnani and Satish Shukla appearing for the petitioners Gokhale and Deoolkar argued that the government should have applied the modified criteria in Gokhale as well as Deoolkar's case in women category the way they applied the modified criteria for giving the award to Navle in the men's category during the pandemic.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAfter hearing Bhavnani and Shukla, the benches directed the government to consider the same. It is following this direction that the government formed the committee.\n\nAdditional Government Pleader Manish Upadhyaye submitted that the committee will take about three weeks to take a decision.\n\nHe submitted that a week before a public announcement of these awards, if the petitioners are not selected for the award, then they will be intimated so that they can avail any other legal remedy. The bench agreed to this.\n\nPublished By: Vivek Published On: Feb 14, 2025",

Bakoria further wrote, \"As per the inquiry and the report, it reveals that Mr Rajvardhan Hangargekar has started his academic career at Terna Public School, Osmanabad. It is governed by the school code prescribed by the Government of Maharashtra.\"\n\n\"At the time of admission of Rajvardhan Hangargekar in 1st standard at Terna Public School (primary division) Osmanabad, the date of birth is provided as 10/01/2001. The school record speaks that the birth date of Mr Rajvardhan Hangagekar up to seventh standard is recorded as 10/01/2001.\"\n\nThe commissioner alleged that the school made \"unauthorised corrections\" to Hangargekar's birth date. \"As per the general register maintained by the Terna Public School, Osmanabad, his birth date is 10/01/2001. It appears unauthorised corrections (were) made by the Head Master and his birth date is recorded as 10/11/2002 at the time of fresh application for 8th standard.\"\n\n\"If the headmaster requires any corrections in the birth date, it is necessary to take prior permission of the education officer of the concerned district. However, no such permission has been taken for making changes in the birth date of Mr. Rajvardhan Hangargekar.\n\n\"Therefore said corrections are made in excess of power and amount to cheating and forgery in government records,\" the senior IAS officer stated.\n\nLast week, Hangargekar was bought by Chennai Super Kings for Rs 1.5 crore at the IPL 2022 mega auction. \"On the basis of the fabricated record, Mr Rajvardhan Hangargekar seems to have secured a position in the national team of India. As per the report of Chief Executive Officer (IAS) Zilla Parishad, Osmanabad, the birth date of said player is 10/01/2001 and therefore, he has completed 21 years of age at the time of the tournament.\n\n\"Despite the fact, he has secured a position in the U19 team participating in the ICC (U-19) World Cup 2022.\"\n\nThe PTI tried to contact Maharashtra Cricket Association secretary Bagban and Hangargekar for a response, but both could not be reached. Earlier Manjot Karla, who struck a match-winning century in the final of 2018 U-19 World Cup, was banned for two years from playing for Delhi, for age fraud.\n\nIn September 2011, Maharashtra's Ankit Bawne was removed from India U-19 squad after the date of birth in his passport did not match with the one in his birth certificate and the BCCI records.",

        "content": "AIFF Media Team\n\nMUMBAI: AIFF President and Chairman, LOC, AFC Women’s Asian Cup India 2022, Shri Praful Patel attended the virtual inauguration of two pitches by Shri Uddhav Thackeray, Chief Minister of Maharashtra, at the upcoming Football Maharashtra Center of Excellence CIDCO in Kharghar, Navi Mumbai.\n\nAlso present were Mr. Aditya Thackeray, Minister of Tourism, Government of Maharashtra, also the President of Mumbai District Football Association (MDFA), along with Mr. Eknath Shinde, Cabinet Minister of Urban Development.\n\nApart from the two world class training pitches, the upcoming state-of-the-art facility will also feature a High-Performance Center along with a 40,000 capacity FIFA approved stadium and also a golf course, rugby stadium and shooting range.\n\nThe training pitches will be handed over for use to the AFC for the Women’s Asian Cup India 2022 and will also feature at the FIFA U17 Women’s World Cup India 2022 in October.\n\n“On account of Makar Sankranti, it is a very auspicious time to inaugurate such a world class facility at the hands of such honourable people,” Mr. Patel averred. “I thank CIDCO for taking up this initiative for developing world class infrastructure and commend the great work they have put in to get it ready in such a short time.”\n\nHe also pointed out the city’s ability to consistently deliver for the big stage. “I am very happy to see the first world-class FIFA stadium coming up in Navi Mumbai which also played host to the FIFA U-17 World Cup in 2017 and will continue to do so for the Women’s Asian Cup 2022 and the FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup in October,” said Mr. Patel.\n\nHe singled out Mr. Aditya Thackeray for his efforts, working together with him at the Western India Football Association (WIFA).\n\n“The Government of Maharashtra, along with Aditya have given us their fullest support in trying to make India a footballing nation,” he said. “I am happy to see that we are making efforts to bring football to all districts of Maharashtra.”\n\nMaharashtra Chief Minister Shri Uddhav Thackeray was elated at the prospect of contributing to this sporting project.\n\n“This is one of the happiest days of my life. We are always focused on work and sometimes we forget about hobbies. I am glad that we are encouraging outdoor sports again which I felt we were slightly lagging behind,” he said.\n\n“Our generation was engrossed in cricket, but this generation is crazy about football,” he continued. “Taking that into account, I am proud that everyone has come together to take this project forward which is very important for a healthy life.”\n\nMr. Thackeray recalled the time he was a spectator in a football stadium and experienced the atmosphere first hand. “I wish that one day we can put out an Indian team in a World Cup on this ground because of these facilities. We want to fulfill the dreams of young boys and girls through this facility,” he concluded.\n\n“I have discussed how to improve infrastructure for developing non-cricket sports and I am confident that under the leadership of the Maharashtra government, football will become the No.1 sport in Maharashtra,” concluded Mr. Patel.",

        "content": "Naushad Shaikh, the former Maharashtra captain, emerged as the most sought-after cricketer during the Maharashtra Premier League (MPL) Player Auction, held in Pune on Tuesday.\n\nWhile Shaikh emerged as the most expensive buy with a price tag of Rs. 6 lakh, bought by Punit Balan Group-owned Kolhapur Tuskers, the auction saw six teams combined splurging almost Rs. 1.20 crore during the event.\n\nWith each of the six MPL franchises being allotted an icon player to be bought pre-auction, the teams had a maximum of Rs. 20 lakh at its disposal, with a minimum of 15 players required to be bought.\n\nShaikh’s bidding saw the Tuskers and Puneri Bappa - with Shaikh’s best friend Ruturaj Gaikwad as its icon player - being involved in a tug-of-war until the Pune franchise pulled out after he had hit a figure 10 times more than his base price of Rs. 60,000.\n\nThe auction saw non-icon players being divided into three categories. The base price for each category was Rs. 60,000, Rs. 40,000 and Rs. 20,000, with those having played Ranji Trophy or senior limited overs’ cricket being in the top bracket.\n\nWhile the Tuskers also got hold of Maharashtra’s Ranji captain Ankeet Bawane (Rs. 2.80 lakh) thus making it a fearsome batting line-up, all-rounder Divyang Hinganekar was the second-most expensive player. Hinganekar was signed by Ratnagiri Jets for Rs. 4.60 lakh. The franchise also had regional superstar Nikhil Naik on its roster, who fetched Rs. 3.60 lakh.\n\nLeg-spinner Prashant Solanki, a member of Chennai Super Kings’ triumphant Indian Premier League campaign who has recently moved to Maharashtra from his alma mater Mumbai, was acquired by Rahul Tripathi-led Eagle Nashik Titans for Rs. 2.40 lakh.\n\nThe tournament will be played at the Maharashtra Cricket Association’s International Stadium at Gahunje, on the outskirts of Pune, from June 15. The tournament will also witness three women’s exhibition matches.\n\nTop picks: Naushad Shaikh (Kolhapur Tuskers) Rs. 6 lakh; Divyang Hinganekar (Ratnagiri Jets) Rs. 4.60 lakh; Yash Nahar (Solapur Royals) Rs. 3.80 lakh; Sahil Autade (Kolhapur Tuskers) Rs. 3.80 lakh; Satyajeet Bachhav (Solapur Royals) Rs. 3.60 lakh; Nikhil Naik (Ratnagiri Jets) Rs. 3.40 lakh.\n\nIcon players (fees yet to be disclosed)\n\nPuneri Bappa (Owner: Pravin Masalewale): Ruturaj Gaikwad\n\nKolhapur Tuskers (Punit Balan Group): Kedar Jadhav\n\nEagle Nashik Titans (Eagle Infra India Ltd.): Rahul Tripathi\n\nChhatrapati Sambhaji Kings (Venkateshwara Industries): Rajvardhan Hangargekar\n\nRatnagiri Jets (Jets Synthesis): Azim Kazi\n\nSolapur Royals (Kapil Sons Explosive LLP): Vicky Ostwal",
