        "content": "ATLANTA (AP) — A judge has ruled that a Georgia railroad can buy land against the will of property owners to build a track, rebuffing a challenge that a libertarian group hoped could make it harder to use eminent domain to take property.\n\nFulton County Superior Court Judge Craig Schwall Sr. ruled Tuesday that the Sandersville Railroad could condemn a 200-foot (60-meter) wide strip of property running 4.5 miles (7.3 kilometers) to build a rail line serving a rock quarry and other users. Landowners fighting the railroad had appealed a Georgia Public Service Commission ruling allowing the land taking.\n\nSchwall kept a freeze on construction for now, with landowners saying they would appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe case matters because private entities need to condemn private land for railroads and facilities including pipelines and electric transmission lines.\n\nThe Sandersville Railroad, owned by an influential Georgia family, wants to connect the quarry to the CSX railroad at Sparta, allowing products to be shipped widely. Sparta is a mostly Black rural town about 85 miles (135 kilometers) southeast of Atlanta in one of Georgia's poorest counties.\n\nSandersville has agreements to buy some of the 18 parcels it needs. But other owners say losing a strip of property would spoil land they treasure, and that some families have owned for a century.\n\n“Every day that Sandersville isn’t coming onto our land and starting to build is a good day,” Diane Smith, one of the owners, said in a statement. “But we won’t rest easy until we know for sure that they’ll never be able to take our land from us.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrian Brodrick, a lawyer for the railroad, urged opposed property owners in a Thursday statement “to return to the negotiating table so we can bring new opportunities and channels of trade to all the citizens of Hancock County and the region.\" He said the spur would have “minimal impacts” on neighbors.\n\nSome people in the rural neighborhood think the railroad would enable expansion at a quarry owned by Heidelberg Materials, a publicly traded German firm. They dislike the quarry because it generates noise, dust and truck traffic.\n\nSupporters say if the railroad is built, the quarry will move its operation farther from houses, trains will reduce trucks on roads and the railroad will build berms to shield residents.\n\nRailroads have long had the power of eminent domain, but Georgia law says such land seizures must be for “public use.” Opponents targeted the project by saying it would only benefit the quarry. The Sandersville Railroad says there are other users, including a company located at the quarry that blends gravel and asphalt for paving. Several companies have said they would truck products to load them onto the new line, saying they want access to markets served by CSX.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchwall found the railroad met the public use standard, saying it was necessary for the “functioning” of Sandersville and \"also serves a public purpose because it will provide a channel of trade in east middle Georgia.”\n\nThe group representing opponents, the Institute for Justice, hoped to use the case to chip away at eminent domain, the power to legally take private land while paying fair compensation.\n\nThe libertarian-leaning legal group lost a landmark 2005 case allowing the city of New London, Connecticut, to take land from one private owner and transfer it to another private owner for economic development. Schwall cited that case in his ruling.\n\n“We remain committed to proving to the courts that a private railroad’s desire to build a speculative new line entirely for the benefit of a handful of private companies is not a public use under the U.S. and Georgia constitutions and Georgia’s eminent domain laws,” Institute for Justice attorney Bill Maurer said in statement.",

        "author": "Unknown",

        "content": "By Andrew Osborn and Greg Torode\n\nLONDON (Reuters) -Russia has what it needs to fight on in Ukraine for at least another year and retains the battlefield initiative, but is struggling to replace its destroyed tanks, experts at a leading security research organisation said on Wednesday.\n\nIn what has become a war of attrition now nearing its three-year mark, both sides are sustaining heavy casualties as Moscow's forces slowly but steadily advance at a time when the scale and nature of any future U.S. military aid to Kyiv remains unclear under U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor now at least, Russia is in a stronger position than Ukraine on the battlefield despite Kyiv seriously reducing the once formidable Russian Black Sea Fleet's room for manoeuvre, experts at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) said.\n\n\"(With) attrition being such an important factor on land Russia has the initiative and Ukraine is fighting a defensive land battle,\" said IISS senior land warfare analyst Ben Barry.\n\n\"Without any ceasefire the most likely contour of the war over the next few months is more of the same. More bloody attrition on land with very heavy casualties on both sides. If Russia wishes to prolong the war I judge it has the potential human, equipment and logistical resources to continue to do so through the rest of this year.\"\n\nTrump has said he wants to end the war as fast as possible though it’s not yet clear how he intends to do that. Ukraine says it needs both European and U.S. help to ensure its security. Russia says it wants full control of four Ukrainian regions it has claimed as its own, something Kyiv rejects, and for Ukraine to be kept out of NATO.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia and Ukraine accuse each other of not being serious about peace negotiations.\n\nIn its annual assessment of military capabilities, the IISS said that Moscow's total defence spending was higher than total European defence spending in purchasing-power-parity terms.\n\nIt said Russia also appeared better able to maintain the size of its military than Ukraine.\n\n\"While Russia appears to be able to sustain the manning of its forces, evidence suggests that Ukraine, which generally kept its casualty figures secret, has suffered a serious drain on its personnel – with many ground units under-strength,\" the report said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkraine's Defence Ministry this week launched a recruitment drive to attract 18-to-24-year-olds to military service for a year in an attempt to address its manpower problem.\n\n'TANK PROBLEM'\n\nRussia, the report said, had a serious tank and armoured vehicle problem which meant it was taking heavier personnel losses on the battlefield.\n\nMoscow lost 1,400 tanks in 2024 and is struggling to make new tanks at a fast enough rate to replace the old ones despite increasing production of advanced models like the T-90M tank.\n\n\"Russia is increasingly trading quality for quantity to support its war effort,\" the report said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The scale of its equipment losses fighting against\n\nUkraine has meant that, to keep units equipped, it has had\n\nto draw down from its stocks of Soviet-era armour.\"\n\nThat has seen Moscow fall back on small numbers of vintage armoured personnel carriers built in the 1950s and tanks built in the 1960s, said the IISS, which estimates Russia has lost a total of 4,400 main battle tanks in the war so far.\n\n\"The remaining equipment in store could allow Russia to sustain the current rate of loss in the short term, but a significant number of these platforms would require deep and costly refurbishment,\" the report said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHenry Boyd, the institute's senior fellow for military capability, said Russia would need to significantly expand its production of new armoured vehicles or look to imports.\n\nAnother problem for Russia, said Nigel Gould-Davies, a Russia specialist at the same research centre, was that the current course of the Russian economy - which he said was suffering from \"fundamental monetary imbalances\" after being put on a war footing - was unsustainable \"in the longer term.\"\n\n(Reporting By Andrew Osborn in London and Greg Torode in Hong Kong; Editing by Gerry Doyle, Jon Boyle and Sharon Singleton)",

        "title": "Zoe Saldaña Reacts to Karla Sofía Gascón’s Tweets: ‘It Makes Me Really Sad Because I Don’t Support [It]’",
        "author": "Ryan Lattanzio",
        "published_date": "2025-01-31",
        "content": "Zoe Saldaña has responded to the ongoing fallout of “Emilia Pérez” co-star Karla Sofía Gascón’s resurfaced past tweets that have dominated entertainment news since Thursday. Gascón’s past remarks on X — ranging from glib comments about Hitler to disses against George Floyd and diversity at the Academy Awards themselves — have put the trans actress and potential Oscar history-maker’s campaign in jeopardy. Gascón is the first trans performer nominated for an acting Oscar.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter reported the news of the actress’s response first out of a London Q&A on Friday held with Saldaña, who is a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nominee for her role in Jacques Audiard’s Spanish-language musical, a Netflix release.\n\nSaldaña, according to the outlet, was asked about her co-star’s tweets, and said, “I’m still processing everything that has transpired in the last couple of days, and I’m sad. It makes me really sad because I don’t support [it], and I don’t have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group. I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural, and gender equity. And it just saddens me.”\n\nIndieWire confirmed the Q&A took place in London Friday as moderated by Edith Bowman. Watch an excerpt in the video above.\n\nSaldaña continued, “It saddens me that we are having to face this setback right now. But I’m happy that you’re all here and that you’re all still showing up for Emilia because the message that this film has is so powerful and the change that it can bring forward to communities that are marginalized day in and day out is important. And all that I can attest is that all of us that came together to tell this story. We came together for love and for respect and curiosity, and we will continue to spread that message. That’s all we can say right now. Thank you.”\n\nGascón offered a statement of apology Thursday night after major trades and media outlets began reporting on the tweets. “I want to acknowledge the conversation around my past social media posts that have caused hurt. As someone in a marginalized community, I know this suffering all too well and I am deeply sorry to those I have caused pain. All my life I have fought for a better world. I believe light will always triumph over darkness,” Gascón wrote.\n\nIn a translated follow-up statement obtained by THR on Friday, Gascón elaborated, saying, “I’m sorry, but I can no longer allow this campaign of hate and misinformation to affect me and my family, so at their request I am closing my account on X.”\n\nGascón did deactivate her X account as of Friday, and the THR exclusive statement continued, “I have been threatened with death, insulted, abused and harassed to the point of exhaustion. I have a wonderful daughter to protect, whom I love madly and who supports me in everything.”\n\n“Emilia Pérez” is up for 13 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Variety, in the outlet’s Thursday coverage, sought individual translation of the Spanish-language tweets that have put Gascón under fire. Gascón is a Mexican citizen of Spanish origin. She was already under scrutiny after seeming to implicate fellow nominee Fernanda Torres’ publicity in attacking her online in a viral clip shared online Wednesday.\n\n“What I don’t like are social media teams — people who work with these people — trying to diminish our work, like me and my movie, because that doesn’t lead anywhere,” per a Variety translation of an interview published in Brazilian daily Folha de S.Paulo. “You don’t need to tear down someone’s work to highlight another’s. I have never, at any point, said anything bad about Fernanda Torres or her movie. However, there are people working with Fernanda Torres tearing me and ‘Emilia Pérez’ down. That speaks more about their movie than mine.”\n\nIt was thought Gascón’s remarks could have violated Oscar campaigning rules, which state a nominee is not allowed to disparage another nominee. That was debunked, with a statement from Gascón Wednesday night reading, “In my recent comments, I was referencing the toxicity and violent hate speech on social media that I sadly continue to experience. Fernanda has been a wonderful ally, and no one directly associated with her has been anything but supportive and hugely generous.”",

ATG Entertainment, which runs the venue, told BBC News that it took a “zero tolerance” approach to abuse.\n\nWebb added that some of the worst abuse had occurred during performances in London. “I remember one guy who was shouting the F-[word] slur,” he said. “It has really opened my eyes because we’re in such a bubble in this industry.

        "content": "Posted in Cars, Local News, Perodua / By Danny Tan / February 13 2025 5:13 pm\n\nHere’s some entertainment for football fans who so happen are into cars. Sounds bizarre, but Manchester United has approached Perodua for a sponsorship deal. Yes, that once-great football club that dominated English football, approaching the maker of the Nippa for its logo!\n\nIf you think that’s some comedown for the Red Devils, guess what, the EPL club’s invitation was rebuffed by Rawang. This was revealed by Perodua chairman Tan Sri Asmat Kamaludin at the launch of the Perodua National Amateur Golf Series at Saujana Golf and Country Club today, reported by NST.\n\nWhile I wasn’t there to witness what would have been a fun (and funny) press conference, this piece of gold apparently came from nowhere. Asmat was responding to a question about sponsorships for local football teams when he mentioned Manchester United.\n\n“There have been requests, and there’s one team… I don’t know if I should say this, but I received a letter from Manchester United asking if we would put our logo on one of their shirts and sponsor them,” Asmat said.\n\nArsenal fan and Perodua chairman Tan Sri Asmat Kamaludin, second from left\n\nMU’s commercial department wouldn’t have known that they were approaching a Gooner. “If we do that for Manchester United, then it wouldn’t be fair to my Arsenal, you know?” Asmat said, declaring his allegiance to the North London club.\n\nThe P2 chairman said that the carmaker – Malaysia’s perennial market leader and now the No.2 carmaker in ASEAN by sales after Toyota – is open to sponsorship opportunities within Malaysia, but football teams are out of the question.\n\n“If people ask for support, we will consider, especially for Malaysian sports. But we have to be selective. For example, in the M-League, I’m from Johor. If I support Johor Darul Ta’zim, I might lose support from customers in Selangor or Kelantan. So, we have to be very careful about who we support and sponsor,” he said, adding that Perodua prefers to support individual sports such as golf and tennis. P2 has been backing badminton for some time now.\n\nClick to enlarge\n\nIf you’re wondering why Manchester United is going around with cap in hand, you might not realise that the club is a far cry from the all-conquering side (in both sporting and commercial terms) under Sir Alex Ferguson. United lost almost £300 million over the past three years and new co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is considering further redundancies at the club after already sacking 250 staff, plus ending Ferguson’s status as a paid ambassador.\n\nInfrastructure wise, Old Trafford, once the feared Theatre of Dreams, has of late made headlines for embarrassing things like a leaking roof and a rodent infestation – all while Ineos raised ticket prices and ended concessions for kids and pensioners. It’s reported that the club might even close their London office in Kensington to cut costs.\n\nIt’s not looking good on the pitch as well. After paying Sporting Lisbon £11 million to bring in Ruben Amorim (they also had to pay the sacked Erik ten Hag £10.4 million in compensation) mid-season, the Portuguese coach has won 10 and lost eight of his 20 games at the wheel (anyone missing Ole?). The Red Devils are currently 13th in the English Premier League.\n\nLooking to sell your car? Sell it with Carro.",

        "content": "Other People’s Money plays in the Panorama section at the Berlin Film Festival. The series premiere will be a full circle moment for Jan Schomburg – his first film, Above Us Only Sky, played in the same Berlinale sidebar in 2011.\n\nThe German writer and director is speaking to Deadline from his Berlin Film Festival base. The warehouse-like space will serve as the venue for the after party following the premiere of the series that he wrote, and upon which he was showrunner.\n\nOther People’s Money takes in a tax fraud that centered on so-called cum-ex trades, and the work of those seeking to expose the wrongdoing. The shorthand explanation often used for those not familiar with the complex financial machinations is it’s “a bit like parents claiming a child benefit for two children when there is only one child in the family.”\n\nThe series was inspired by the CumEx files, the investigation by a host of European journalists and news outlets into the tax double dealing, as well as the Oliver Schröm book ‘Die Akte Scholz’ and research by Christian Salewski and “Det Store Skatterøveri” by Niels Fastrup and Thomas G. Svaneborg.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nSchomburg says he did not pay close attention when news of the multi-billion Euro scandal first broke – “I thought, oh, it’s just some stupid shit where some rich people stole some money from us,” he says – but Michael Polle, who produces Other People’s Money with Ole Søndberg, urged him to look closer.\n\n“I started to do some research and I found the characters involved in the real case really interesting. I had the feeling it was as if Shakespeare and [German-American director] Lubitsch had teamed up in a writers’ room and created these characters.”\n\nPart of the story revolves around an older tax lawyer, Bernd (Justus von Dohnányi) and his younger counterpart, Sven (Nils Strunk). The duo team up to illegally work the angles on the tax rules. Schomburg’s take was to give their relationship a rom-com spin.\n\n“If you if you look at the structure of the storytelling closely, it is built up a little bit like a romantic comedy,” he says. “They team up together, and this whole process of them forming a company together is a little bit like a marriage and I really wrote that part like a love scene. [Bernd] says: ‘You know, I thought about something, maybe we could form a company together. You don’t have to say yes, immediately. You can think about it.’ [Sven] says: ‘I don’t have to think about it, yes, I do.’”\n\nTom Tykwer’s X Filme produces with True Content Entertainment and, fittingly for a drama that spans Europe, a host of broadcasters from across the continent. These broadcasters will air the show in their respective countries: ZDF (Germany), DR (Denmark), NRK Norway), SVT (Sweden), RUV (Iceland), YLE (Finland), NPO (Netherlands), VRT (Belgium). Beta Film is distributing and the series is a highlight of its London TV Screenings lineup.\n\nChristine Fenzl\n\nOther People’s Money opens with a man walking into a garage full of expensive cars and lying naked, face down, on the bonnet of one of the luxury automobiles. But that is not a sign of what follows. As the drama unfolds, Schomburg says he set himself a guideline: “I don’t want to show the villains in a sexy way.”\n\nHe speaks of a “weird philosophical emptiness” at the heart of the perpetrators of the fraud. “I always asked myself, why are they doing it? They already have a lot of money. Then they get more and then they don’t do anything with it. They just pay it into some bank accounts.”\n\nMaking a TV series was the hardest work Schomburg has ever done, he says. “It’s like, okay, episode six is finished, but in one week it’s the deadline for episode seven. It’s crazy industrial work and it’s also nice somehow. You don’t think: ‘Do I feel like writing?’ You get into this industrial process. You just have to do it.”\n\nThe story that inspired Other People’s Money is public record. For Schomburg, a tale of greed and disregard for the wider population is actually inspiring given the actions of the people who came together to expose the fraud.\n\n“It’s possible to think that the financial markets are not just there for themselves or for some rich people, they are there to serve us,” he explains. “I also tried to convey this idea that now is the time to think in a collective kind of way. There are some very inspiring people who show us that we can fight and we can win.”",

Here are some of your comments.\n\nWith strong characters like Moana, Disney made some progress in improving representation in its films (Image credit: Walt Disney Animation Studios)\n\nMany of the responses that we received in the comments here on the site, on social media or by email, expressed disappointment. \"It’s incredible to witness how spineless so many of the US corporations are. Now it would be just the best time to double down on it,\" one person wrote on Facebook. \"To obey Trump and Musk in such ways is to commit self-sabotage. Disney's leaders know better than this, or at least ought to,\" someone wrote in the comments on this site.\n\nOther people pointed out that DEI initiatives are related to workforce policies, not to the characters in movies or shows. Disney doesn't need to have a DEI policy to write and depict minority characters on screen, some argued. Nor does rewording its DEI policies mean that it will no longer be able to hire creatives from minority backgrounds.\n\n\"They aren't getting rid of their DEI policies, they're reorganizing their creative writing teams and renaming them (and their content warnings) to work around the expectation of laxing those initiatives,\" one person wrote on Facebook.\n\nWhile it would appear much of Disney's reaction to cancelling and reworking its DEI policies on paper may not affect content, the fear is without a committed push to promote new voices, unheard stories and design characters from minority backgrounds with care, there's little impetus on Disney.\n\nOthers questioned how much progress Disney has really made on representations of diversity. \"Disney hasn’t been shy about doing the bare minimum for the last couple decades,\" one person wrote. \"It’s only been recently they pushed diversity or any kind of representations of characters of color of their respective countries yet I feel that they do less then most would expect from the world's leading entertainment animation studio.\"\n\nGet the Creative Bloq Newsletter Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nDisney will no longer show warnings about negative depictions in older films (Image credit: Alladin)\n\nBut another change that Disney has made is the decision to scale back the content advisory warnings it had begun using to flag up negative depictions of minorities in some older films. These will now appear in sleeve notes rather than on screen. Some readers were concerned that this could allow casual racism to slip by unchecked.\n\nSiham Zerkak, senior account director at JVM London, told us by email that he was never a big Disney fan, partly because of the lack of representation and the misrepresentation of minorities in the studio's movies. He notes that while we've had Coco, Encanto, Moana and a Black Ariel, Disney still \"massively lacks Muslim representation that's not filled with stereotypes\", citing Aladdin as one movie with problematic racial stigmas.\n\n\"This misrepresentation of the Middle East and Arabs is not only simplistic, it's also dangerous,\" Siham says. \"Kids are the future of this world, and ensuring that we fill their worlds with true representation of all the communities that make part of our society is of huge importance so they can be aware and learn to embrace different cultures. And this can only be done if we tell authentic stories on screen and behind the screen that truly represent the diverse world we live in.\"\n\nDisney employees themselves appear to be unhappy about what's being seen as a submission to Trump's policies. The Deadline cited one unnamed insider as saying: \"What’s next? Where do we go from here? What do we stand for now, keeping MAGA happy? “This is not what I expected from Bob — I thought he had our back.”\n\nIf you have an opinion to add to the discussion, let us know below.

        "content": "Listen to the article 3 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nTaking its hobby and collectors business offline, Fanatics Collectibles is opening its first-ever brick-and-mortar store this spring in London, according to a company news release.\n\nThe 8,647-square-foot store, located at 54 Regent Street in the heart of London’s West End, will focus primarily on sports and entertainment trading cards and feature such brands as Topps, Merlin, Match Attax and Bowman. Fanatics-owned Topps last year secured the exclusive trading card rights to the Premier League and will launch products prior to the start of the 2025/2026 season.\n\nIn addition to trading cards, the new store will also feature apparel from both Topps and Fanatics-owned Mitchell & Ness, plus such memorabilia as signed kits, jerseys and balls.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nFanatics’ first foray into brick and mortar includes an in-store breaking studio, a trading card singles experience, card opening and trading areas, and customer education touchpoints, per the release. The centerpiece of the store will house rare collectible trading cards plus a suspended circular screen showing created content on current and upcoming products.\n\n“We are incredibly excited to cut the ribbon on this amazing community-building retail space, one that we hope will delight collectors and be a true home for the hobby in Europe,” David Leiner, Topps President of Trading Cards, said in a statement. “It’ll be a destination for millions of fans as well as our own internal partners – and team and club partners, the latter using our dedicated space to launch and showcase new products in a way that has never been done before.”\n\nAccording to Fanatics, there currently are fewer than five Topps-partner hobby shops in the United Kingdom and less than 30 in Europe. The choice to open this store in the U.K. could be a signal that the retailer wants to test a growth strategy in the region, Managing Director of Retail at Global Data Neil Saunders said via email.\n\n“On the surface, it’s odd that Fanatics has chosen a market like the UK, which has a less developed trading card scene than the US, for its first flagship,” Saunders said. “However, this is likely a bid by Fanatics to test the waters and to try and jump-start the phenomenon in the UK. If they can do this, they will have another huge market that they can expand in and use as a springboard for growth across Europe.”\n\nRegent Street, which is one of the busiest streets in London, could help maximize potential visitors and give Fanatics global exposure.\n\n“Whether this works remains to be seen,” Saunders added. “They have made every effort to make the store attractive and engaging so that it pulls in general shoppers as well as trading card enthusiasts. But trying to expand what is an embryonic category isn’t easy. It will take time.”",

        "author": "Unknown",
        "published_date": "Unknown",
        "content": "ATLANTA (AP) — A judge has ruled that a Georgia railroad can buy land against the will of property owners to build a track, rebuffing a challenge that a libertarian group hoped could make it harder to use eminent domain to take property.\n\nFulton County Superior Court Judge Craig Schwall Sr. ruled Tuesday that the Sandersville Railroad could condemn a 200-foot (60-meter) wide strip of property running 4.5 miles (7.3 kilometers) to build a rail line serving a rock quarry and other users. Landowners fighting the railroad had appealed a Georgia Public Service Commission ruling allowing the land taking.\n\nSchwall kept a freeze on construction for now, with landowners saying they would appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe case matters because private entities need to condemn private land for railroads and facilities including pipelines and electric transmission lines.\n\nThe Sandersville Railroad, owned by an influential Georgia family, wants to connect the quarry to the CSX railroad at Sparta, allowing products to be shipped widely. Sparta is a mostly Black rural town about 85 miles (135 kilometers) southeast of Atlanta in one of Georgia's poorest counties.\n\nSandersville has agreements to buy some of the 18 parcels it needs. But other owners say losing a strip of property would spoil land they treasure, and that some families have owned for a century.\n\n“Every day that Sandersville isn’t coming onto our land and starting to build is a good day,” Diane Smith, one of the owners, said in a statement. “But we won’t rest easy until we know for sure that they’ll never be able to take our land from us.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrian Brodrick, a lawyer for the railroad, urged opposed property owners in a Thursday statement “to return to the negotiating table so we can bring new opportunities and channels of trade to all the citizens of Hancock County and the region.\" He said the spur would have “minimal impacts” on neighbors.\n\nSome people in the rural neighborhood think the railroad would enable expansion at a quarry owned by Heidelberg Materials, a publicly traded German firm. They dislike the quarry because it generates noise, dust and truck traffic.\n\nSupporters say if the railroad is built, the quarry will move its operation farther from houses, trains will reduce trucks on roads and the railroad will build berms to shield residents.\n\nRailroads have long had the power of eminent domain, but Georgia law says such land seizures must be for “public use.” Opponents targeted the project by saying it would only benefit the quarry. The Sandersville Railroad says there are other users, including a company located at the quarry that blends gravel and asphalt for paving. Several companies have said they would truck products to load them onto the new line, saying they want access to markets served by CSX.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchwall found the railroad met the public use standard, saying it was necessary for the “functioning” of Sandersville and \"also serves a public purpose because it will provide a channel of trade in east middle Georgia.”\n\nThe group representing opponents, the Institute for Justice, hoped to use the case to chip away at eminent domain, the power to legally take private land while paying fair compensation.\n\nThe libertarian-leaning legal group lost a landmark 2005 case allowing the city of New London, Connecticut, to take land from one private owner and transfer it to another private owner for economic development. Schwall cited that case in his ruling.\n\n“We remain committed to proving to the courts that a private railroad’s desire to build a speculative new line entirely for the benefit of a handful of private companies is not a public use under the U.S. and Georgia constitutions and Georgia’s eminent domain laws,” Institute for Justice attorney Bill Maurer said in statement.",

        "author": "Unknown",
        "published_date": "Unknown",
        "content": "By Andrew Osborn and Greg Torode\n\nLONDON (Reuters) -Russia has what it needs to fight on in Ukraine for at least another year and retains the battlefield initiative, but is struggling to replace its destroyed tanks, experts at a leading security research organisation said on Wednesday.\n\nIn what has become a war of attrition now nearing its three-year mark, both sides are sustaining heavy casualties as Moscow's forces slowly but steadily advance at a time when the scale and nature of any future U.S. military aid to Kyiv remains unclear under U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor now at least, Russia is in a stronger position than Ukraine on the battlefield despite Kyiv seriously reducing the once formidable Russian Black Sea Fleet's room for manoeuvre, experts at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) said.\n\n\"(With) attrition being such an important factor on land Russia has the initiative and Ukraine is fighting a defensive land battle,\" said IISS senior land warfare analyst Ben Barry.\n\n\"Without any ceasefire the most likely contour of the war over the next few months is more of the same. More bloody attrition on land with very heavy casualties on both sides. If Russia wishes to prolong the war I judge it has the potential human, equipment and logistical resources to continue to do so through the rest of this year.\"\n\nTrump has said he wants to end the war as fast as possible though it’s not yet clear how he intends to do that. Ukraine says it needs both European and U.S. help to ensure its security. Russia says it wants full control of four Ukrainian regions it has claimed as its own, something Kyiv rejects, and for Ukraine to be kept out of NATO.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia and Ukraine accuse each other of not being serious about peace negotiations.\n\nIn its annual assessment of military capabilities, the IISS said that Moscow's total defence spending was higher than total European defence spending in purchasing-power-parity terms.\n\nIt said Russia also appeared better able to maintain the size of its military than Ukraine.\n\n\"While Russia appears to be able to sustain the manning of its forces, evidence suggests that Ukraine, which generally kept its casualty figures secret, has suffered a serious drain on its personnel – with many ground units under-strength,\" the report said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkraine's Defence Ministry this week launched a recruitment drive to attract 18-to-24-year-olds to military service for a year in an attempt to address its manpower problem.\n\n'TANK PROBLEM'\n\nRussia, the report said, had a serious tank and armoured vehicle problem which meant it was taking heavier personnel losses on the battlefield.\n\nMoscow lost 1,400 tanks in 2024 and is struggling to make new tanks at a fast enough rate to replace the old ones despite increasing production of advanced models like the T-90M tank.\n\n\"Russia is increasingly trading quality for quantity to support its war effort,\" the report said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The scale of its equipment losses fighting against\n\nUkraine has meant that, to keep units equipped, it has had\n\nto draw down from its stocks of Soviet-era armour.\"\n\nThat has seen Moscow fall back on small numbers of vintage armoured personnel carriers built in the 1950s and tanks built in the 1960s, said the IISS, which estimates Russia has lost a total of 4,400 main battle tanks in the war so far.\n\n\"The remaining equipment in store could allow Russia to sustain the current rate of loss in the short term, but a significant number of these platforms would require deep and costly refurbishment,\" the report said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHenry Boyd, the institute's senior fellow for military capability, said Russia would need to significantly expand its production of new armoured vehicles or look to imports.\n\nAnother problem for Russia, said Nigel Gould-Davies, a Russia specialist at the same research centre, was that the current course of the Russian economy - which he said was suffering from \"fundamental monetary imbalances\" after being put on a war footing - was unsustainable \"in the longer term.\"\n\n(Reporting By Andrew Osborn in London and Greg Torode in Hong Kong; Editing by Gerry Doyle, Jon Boyle and Sharon Singleton)",

        "content": "Zoe Saldaña has responded to the ongoing fallout of “Emilia Pérez” co-star Karla Sofía Gascón’s resurfaced past tweets that have dominated entertainment news since Thursday. Gascón’s past remarks on X — ranging from glib comments about Hitler to disses against George Floyd and diversity at the Academy Awards themselves — have put the trans actress and potential Oscar history-maker’s campaign in jeopardy. Gascón is the first trans performer nominated for an acting Oscar.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter reported the news of the actress’s response first out of a London Q&A on Friday held with Saldaña, who is a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nominee for her role in Jacques Audiard’s Spanish-language musical, a Netflix release.\n\nSaldaña, according to the outlet, was asked about her co-star’s tweets, and said, “I’m still processing everything that has transpired in the last couple of days, and I’m sad. It makes me really sad because I don’t support [it], and I don’t have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group. I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural, and gender equity. And it just saddens me.”\n\nIndieWire confirmed the Q&A took place in London Friday as moderated by Edith Bowman. Watch an excerpt in the video above.\n\nSaldaña continued, “It saddens me that we are having to face this setback right now. But I’m happy that you’re all here and that you’re all still showing up for Emilia because the message that this film has is so powerful and the change that it can bring forward to communities that are marginalized day in and day out is important. And all that I can attest is that all of us that came together to tell this story. We came together for love and for respect and curiosity, and we will continue to spread that message. That’s all we can say right now. Thank you.”\n\nGascón offered a statement of apology Thursday night after major trades and media outlets began reporting on the tweets. “I want to acknowledge the conversation around my past social media posts that have caused hurt. As someone in a marginalized community, I know this suffering all too well and I am deeply sorry to those I have caused pain. All my life I have fought for a better world. I believe light will always triumph over darkness,” Gascón wrote.\n\nIn a translated follow-up statement obtained by THR on Friday, Gascón elaborated, saying, “I’m sorry, but I can no longer allow this campaign of hate and misinformation to affect me and my family, so at their request I am closing my account on X.”\n\nGascón did deactivate her X account as of Friday, and the THR exclusive statement continued, “I have been threatened with death, insulted, abused and harassed to the point of exhaustion. I have a wonderful daughter to protect, whom I love madly and who supports me in everything.”\n\n“Emilia Pérez” is up for 13 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Variety, in the outlet’s Thursday coverage, sought individual translation of the Spanish-language tweets that have put Gascón under fire. Gascón is a Mexican citizen of Spanish origin. She was already under scrutiny after seeming to implicate fellow nominee Fernanda Torres’ publicity in attacking her online in a viral clip shared online Wednesday.\n\n“What I don’t like are social media teams — people who work with these people — trying to diminish our work, like me and my movie, because that doesn’t lead anywhere,” per a Variety translation of an interview published in Brazilian daily Folha de S.Paulo. “You don’t need to tear down someone’s work to highlight another’s. I have never, at any point, said anything bad about Fernanda Torres or her movie. However, there are people working with Fernanda Torres tearing me and ‘Emilia Pérez’ down. That speaks more about their movie than mine.”\n\nIt was thought Gascón’s remarks could have violated Oscar campaigning rules, which state a nominee is not allowed to disparage another nominee. That was debunked, with a statement from Gascón Wednesday night reading, “In my recent comments, I was referencing the toxicity and violent hate speech on social media that I sadly continue to experience. Fernanda has been a wonderful ally, and no one directly associated with her has been anything but supportive and hugely generous.”",

        "content": "Bowel cancer prediction test for IBD patients 90% accurate\n\n30 January 2025 Dominic Hughes Health correspondent, BBC News\n\nPA\n\nA new method for detecting bowel cancer is more than 90% accurate at predicting which higher-risk people will develop the disease, according to research. About 500,000 people in the UK live with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's and ulcerative colitis. Currently, they are offered regular checks for pre-cancerous growths in their gut, which, if detected, indicate about a 30% chance of bowel cancer developing over 10 years. But the UK research found DNA changes in those pre-cancerous cells, when analysed by an algorithm, were more than 90% accurate in predicting who would develop bowel cancer over the next five years.\n\nThe researchers used tissue samples from IBD patients - but it is hoped their method can be used to develop a simple blood test to identify those IBD patients most at risk.\n\nCraig Foster Craig Foster's wife, Fariba, died of bowel cancer last year\n\n\"Research like this will save lives,\" Craig Foster, from Waterlooville, Hants, whose wife, Fariba, died of bowel cancer in February 2024, said. Fariba had lived with ulcerative colitis since she was 18, when three-quarters of her bowel were removed. \"It gives me comfort to know that there are scientists working right now so that no-one has to experience the same situation Fariba was in,\" Craig said. \"Fariba died just six months after she was diagnosed. \"Even though it was a short time, it was the worst time. \"Cancer takes no prisoners - and it doesn't matter who you are or from what walk of life, everyone is affected in some way,\"\n\nThe Institute of Cancer Research Prof Trevor Graham says the new test should help identify those at high risk, putting the minds of many others at rest\n\nProf Trevor Graham, from the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said: \"Most people with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease won't develop bowel cancer. \"But for those that have these conditions and are showing signs of pre-cancer in their colon, there are some tough decisions to make. \"Either they have it monitored regularly, in the hope that it doesn't become cancer, or they have their bowel removed to guarantee they don't get cancer in the future. \"Neither of these options are particularly pleasant. \"Our test and algorithm give people with IBD, and the doctors who care for them, the best possible information so that they can make the right decision about how to manage their cancer risk.\"\n\n'Hugely exciting'\n\nMarianne Radcliffe, of the charity Crohn's & Colitis UK, said this was really positive news for those living with the conditions. \"People tell us that one of the hardest things about living with Crohn's or colitis is the uncertainty - in everyday life and in the long term. \"Just as with inflammatory bowel disease, we know the earlier you find out about cancer, the better. \"Anything that enables early detection with quicker, less invasive diagnostic tests, removing some of that uncertainty, is hugely exciting.\"\n\n'Focus resources'",

        "content": "The Pentagon is developing AI-enabled satellite technology.\n\nAI satellites offer advantages amid intensifying competition in space.\n\nThey could supercharge data analysis and help evade the consequences of a Chinese cyber-attack.\n\nA vast network of military satellites belonging to the US has long underpinned its dominance in space. But China is challenging the US status as the space superpower, and its satellite system is in the crosshairs.\n\nDefense News reported last month that the US Navy is moving forward with plans to build a network of fully autonomous satellites that are able to navigate independently without GPS or ground control.\n\nAnalysts say that AI could help the US stay ahead, providing its satellites with the capacity to evade the consequences of a potentially crippling attack, as well as more power to collect and analyze large amounts of data.\n\nThe race for satellite dominance\n\nThe stakes in the battle for satellite supremacy are high, Melanie Garson, an associate professor in International Conflict Resolution & International Security at University College London, told Business Insider.\n\nThe winner would control a vital aspect of space infrastructure, which would also provide an advantage in intelligence gathering and precision strikes in the event of a war.\n\nAI \"will provide additional capabilities for surveillance and espionage as well as being able to interfere with the other's space assets through spectrum warfare or cyberattacks,\" Garson said.\n\nThe US has hundreds of military satellites in orbit, with China and Russia not far behind.\n\nIf a war were to break out between the US and China, military experts say that China has the capability to do serious damage to US space-based assets through a range of anti-satellite, or ASAT, capabilities, including programming its satellites to attack others.\n\nA CIA report that leaked in 2023 said China was focusing its efforts in the event of a war on hacking the systems used to control US satellite networks.\n\nSystems confrontation and destruction warfare is believed to be a preferred Chinese military tactic for 21st-century warfare.\n\nCrippling these systems would leave satellites unable to transfer communications and data, or even coordinate with each other, the report said.\n\nRelated stories\n\nAI could be the key\n\nAI for satellites could be crucial to preserving US capabilities. Unlike satellites that require human input, autonomous satellites can operate independently, processing and analyzing data to make their own decisions.\n\nThe autonomy makes them less vulnerable to possible attacks on bases or communications networks or to being cut off from operators by electronic warfare like signal jamming, said Clayton Swope, deputy director of the Aerospace Security Project and a senior fellow in the Defense and Security Department at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\"Decentralized decision-making may add resilience by decreasing the reliance on ground-based infrastructure,\" Krista Langeland, deputy lead of the RAND Space Enterprise Initiative, told BI. \"AI capabilities could also help with detection and characterization of an attack.\"\n\nAnother advantage is that AI could help process vast amounts of data in space, and identify potentially hostile satellites more quickly.\n\n\"Space is huge,\" Swope said, \"so AI will help satellites better understand what's happening around them and keep track of what other satellites are doing.\"\n\n\"That could help US satellites maneuver to avoid accidental collisions but also stay clear of potentially hostile adversarial satellites,\" he said.\n\nA distant goal\n\nThe power of the technology to revolutionize US satellite technology and security is significant, Alison Grey, a satellites expert at PA Consulting, told BI.\n\n\"Ultimately, AI-enabled automation can enable a network to react and recover from various threats in space,\" she said, \"whether that's from natural phenomena, anomalies in one's own system, or potentially hostile activity.\"\n\nHowever, while the technology is already being applied in some military satellites, realizing its full potential is likely to be some way off.\n\nSpace Force's former top acquisition official, Frank Calvelli, told an event last year that he expects satellites to be \"significantly more autonomous\" within the next 10 to 15 years.\n\nEven so, efforts are intensifying to begin realizing its potential. Defense News said that the US Navy is researching a fully autonomous model, the Autosat, and wants to take the tests further.\n\n\"We've done a demo of this and proven out the principles and are looking for the next step,\" Steven Meier, director of space technology at the Naval Research Laboratory, said at a recent summit in Virginia. \"We want to get funding to actually build a system along these lines and launch it.\"",

In a statement to Windows Central, a Microsoft spokesperson said \"To better align with its focus on digital growth, Microsoft has decided to exit the lease at the Microsoft Experience Centre in London early.\"\n\nThe 21,000 square foot Microsoft Store in London first opened in July 2019 to much fanfare. It was designed to be a hub for technology from both Microsoft and its partners, showcasing high-end hardware from third-party OEMs as well as the latest products from Surface and Xbox.\n\nThe store also included an Answer Desk and support area, where Surface and Xbox customers could bring their devices for technical support should they need it. With the only physical storefront now closing, this will no longer be an avenue for support for customers with Surface PCs or Xbox consoles.\n\nUnfortunately, even though the Microsoft Store is located in a prime location in the heart of London's Oxford Street, the store seemingly hasn’t seen much footfall since its original launch date. \"We regularly review our locations and our workforce to ensure we are aligning to market opportunities and make changes to meet the demands of the business\" said the Microsoft spokesperson.\n\nIn addition to being a storefront and experience centre, Microsoft also used the space for business meetings with partners and colleagues. The store featured three floors, with the first two being used as retail space, and the third floor consisting of meeting spaces that the company frequently used.\n\nThe closure of the Microsoft Store in the UK is another blow for Microsoft's consumer facing products and services, which will no longer have a home on the streets of London.

The closure of a loophole allowing importers to avoid taxes on shipments valued less than $800 when sent directly to consumers has left brands like Shein and Temu scrambling .\n\nConcerns about logistics continued yesterday when the US Postal Service said that it is suspending inbound parcels from China and Hong Kong until further notice , effective immediately. While only parcels are impacted, the suspension may cause exporters to use alternative logistics companies like DHL, UPS, and FedEx. That might cause a demand surge that could increase freight costs, an expert told BI.\n\nPDD Holdings, Temu's parent company, was down 6% in premarket trading this morning following the USPS announcement.\n\nCompanies haven't been shy about saying they'll need to raise prices due to tariffs , and the taxes also provide cover to juice their costs regardless of the tariffs' real impact.\n\nEven trade plans that might never come to fruition — Mexico and Canada — could still cause enough uncertainty that they disrupt supply chains, leading to higher prices .\n\nWith so many unknowns, some investors are hedging their bets using outcome ETFs and monitoring 21-day realized volatility to reduce downside risk while not completely cannibalizing their returns.\n\nIf that all sounds like a foreign language to you, there's always the prediction markets.

You can't be relentless. You can't put yourself first,\" Doechii can be heard saying. \"So — put yourself first.\"\n\nThere’s one guarantee in sport. You’ll be told you can’t do it.

And it's an expensive bet: Some Super Bowl advertisers have spent more than $8 million to secure 30 seconds of airtime.\n\nNike's new CEO, Elliott Hill, detailed a turnaround plan in December. Hill rejoined Nike in October after a four-year hiatus. He was formerly the company's president of marketplace and consumer.\n\nSince taking the helm, Hill has called out Nike for certain missteps, such as offering too many discounts and shifting attention away from its relationships with wholesalers.\n\nThe company is also trying to make iconic sneaker brands like Jordans and Air Force 1s hot again by pulling back on supply to boost demand.\n\nNike's revenue slid 8% year over year to $12.4 billion during the three months ending November 30, the company said in December. Nike shares are down roughly 30% over the last 12 months.\n\nNike has also shaken up its marketing department in recent months to elevate its brand storytelling, as Adweek previously reported. Several company veterans returned to or were elevated in the marketing organization over the last year, including former vice president Nicole Hubbard Graham who was named marketing chief.\n\nNike seems to be banking on big cultural moments to get its brand back on track.\n\nThe company debuted a new ad timed around this month's Grammy Awards that highlighted the legacy of its 40-year-old Jordan Brand.\n\nJPMorgan analysts met with Hill and Nike financial chief Matthew Friend at an event on Thursday morning. In a research note recapping the meet and greet, the analysts said Nike execs cited \"excitement\" around Hubbard's return and the brand's representation at \"large consumer moments,\" including the Jordan campaign and a planned Super Bowl ad.\n\nHill told investors in December that Nike had to \"get back to putting sport at the center of everything that we do.\" He said the company would invest in \"big, bold brand marketing efforts\" and important sports moments.",

        "content": "EXCLUSIVE: An episode of Doctor Who that originally featured Huw Edwards has been restored to BBC iPlayer after six months with the disgraced news presenter edited out.\n\nThe UK broadcaster took down Season 2 episode Fear Her last August after Edwards, once the highest-profile news anchor in the country, pleaded guilty to accessing child abuse images.\n\nThe Doctor Who story has now been redubbed to remove Edwards, whose voiceover featured during news clips and commentary. He has been replaced by actress Becky Wright, who has previously done voice work in the Doctor Who podcast series. Elements of the dialog have also been changed.\n\nThe episode features the iPlayer disclaimer: “This programme has been edited since broadcast. There are a number of reasons why a programme may have been edited including legal, contractual or technical issues.”\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nEdwards starred when Chloe Webber, a girl who is terrorized by a demonic version of her abusive dead father, makes everyone disappear in a sports stadium for the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.\n\n“My God, what’s going on here? The crowd has just vanished, right in front of my eyes,” Edwards said. “It’s impossible. Bob, can we go to you in the box? Bob? Not you too?”\n\nThis line has been replaced with: “My God, what’s going on here? The crowd has vanished, they’re gone, everyone has gone. Thousands of people have just gone, right in front of my eyes, it’s impossible. Bob? Bob, can we join you in the box? Not you too Bob…”\n\nWhen the Doctor (David Tennant) and assistant Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) ride to the rescue, Wright’s commentator says: “Just look at this, utterly incredible scenes at the Olympic Stadium. 80,000 athletes and spectators, they disappeared, they’ve come back. They’ve returned, they’ve reappeared. It’s quite incredible.”\n\nAt the time of the removal, the BBC said: “As you would expect we are actively considering the availability of our archive. While we don’t routinely delete content from the BBC archive as it is a matter of historical record, we do consider the continued use and re-use of material on a case-by-case basis.”\n\nIt was perhaps unsurprising that executives looked at the Edwards episode, given the nature of his crimes and that Doctor Who has a young fan base.\n\nEdwards received a six-month suspended prison sentence and apologized for the “repugnant” nature of his offenses after pleading guilty to accessing child abuse images.

        "content": "The popular Apple TV+ series Ted Lasso is expected to return for a fourth season that primarily revolves around the creation of AFC Richmond's women's team.\n\nRumors surrounding the alleged fourth season of Apple's hit sports comedy continue to emerge. Following claims that filming entered pre-production in January 2025, we now have even more details about the show's fourth season, from the same source.\n\nAccording to a social media post by Sigmund Judge, the fourth season of Ted Lasso will focus on the formation of AFC Richmond's women's team rather than the men's team featured in previous seasons. Judge also explains that filming for the fourth season will begin in May or June 2025 in London.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: London filming for #TedLasso S4 is now set to begin in May/June with focus shifting at AFC Richmond to the formation of its women's team. — Sigmund Judge (Feb 5, 2025 at 2:09 PM — Sigmund Judge ( @sigjudge.bsky.social\n\nThe third season of the hit show ended back in 2022, but rumors of an upcoming fourth season give fans continued hope that it will soon return. Apple CEO Tim Cook was among the first to express interest in a fourth season of the show.\n\nIn August 2024, a report suggested that Warner Bros. had picked options for actors playing key roles in Ted Lasso. The list included Hannah Waddingham, Brett Goldstein, and Jeremy Swift, with Jason Sudeikis and Brendan Hunt expected to be reached out to at a later time.\n\nIt's still unclear whether Jason Sudeikis' character will make a return, as the actor was reported to have been satisfied with the original ending of the show. He has expressed no interest in revisiting his role, however, cameos are always possible.\n\nA few months later, in October 2024, \"Season 4\" of Ted Lasso appeared in a production database maintained by the Film & Television Industry Alliance, further corroborating rumors of a fourth season.\n\nA women's team was hinted at at the end of the original 'Ted Lasso' run\n\nSpin offs have always been a possibility. One featuring the character Roy Kent was heavily rumored, and the idea of a women's team was teased in the final moments of the last episode of Ted Lasso, so it's an obvious direction.\n\nActor and repeat \"accidental\" leaker of Ted Lasso news, Nick Mohammad, shared a short video in January 2025 that strongly suggested a new season would be filming soon.\n\nThere are currently no details as to when this supposed fourth season will make its debut, though. Filming is expected to begin in May or June, so Ted Lasso may ultimately return sometime later in 2025 or 2026.",

Details of his health status have not been released.\n\n“If he is ill, I hope he gets well soon, and I’m looking forward to Saturday and a great show,” said Parker, who will now face last-minute replacement Congolese fighter Martin Bakole.\n\nBritish-born Dubois took the interim belt in June by beating Filip Hrgovic and was upgraded to champion when Oleksandr Usyk vacated the title due to his rematch clause with Tyson Fury.\n\nDubois then defended his title in September with a knockout win over fellow Briton Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium in London.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFormer world champion Parker, 33, claimed the World Boxing Organization (WBO) heavyweight title in 2016 by defeating Mexican Andy Ruiz. He lost the title to Joshua in 2018.\n\nBakole was “on his way” to Saudi Arabia from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the heavyweight’s promoter Ben Shalom told Sky Sports in England.\n\nPromoter Frank Warren confirmed at Thursday’s news conference in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, that the no-show by Dubois was because of a medical exam.\n\n“Unfortunately at this moment in time, Daniel is being evaluated by a doctor, and when we have more news, we will share it with you and update you,” Warren said at the news conference.\n\nThe first title defence by Dubois – a brutal fifth-round knockout of Joshua – was staged in front of a record 96,000 fans in the English capital.\n\nSaturday’s main attraction is the rematch between light-heavyweight world champion Artur Beterbiev and Dmitry Bivol.\n\nBeterbiev became the undisputed champion after a contentious points decision over Bivol in October.",

        "content": "Posted in Cars, Local News, Perodua / By Danny Tan / February 13 2025 5:13 pm\n\nHere’s some entertainment for football fans who so happen are into cars. Sounds bizarre, but Manchester United has approached Perodua for a sponsorship deal. Yes, that once-great football club that dominated English football, approaching the maker of the Nippa for its logo!\n\nIf you think that’s some comedown for the Red Devils, guess what, the EPL club’s invitation was rebuffed by Rawang. This was revealed by Perodua chairman Tan Sri Asmat Kamaludin at the launch of the Perodua National Amateur Golf Series at Saujana Golf and Country Club today, reported by NST.\n\nWhile I wasn’t there to witness what would have been a fun (and funny) press conference, this piece of gold apparently came from nowhere. Asmat was responding to a question about sponsorships for local football teams when he mentioned Manchester United.\n\n“There have been requests, and there’s one team… I don’t know if I should say this, but I received a letter from Manchester United asking if we would put our logo on one of their shirts and sponsor them,” Asmat said.\n\nArsenal fan and Perodua chairman Tan Sri Asmat Kamaludin, second from left\n\nMU’s commercial department wouldn’t have known that they were approaching a Gooner. “If we do that for Manchester United, then it wouldn’t be fair to my Arsenal, you know?” Asmat said, declaring his allegiance to the North London club.\n\nThe P2 chairman said that the carmaker – Malaysia’s perennial market leader and now the No.2 carmaker in ASEAN by sales after Toyota – is open to sponsorship opportunities within Malaysia, but football teams are out of the question.\n\n“If people ask for support, we will consider, especially for Malaysian sports. But we have to be selective. For example, in the M-League, I’m from Johor. If I support Johor Darul Ta’zim, I might lose support from customers in Selangor or Kelantan. So, we have to be very careful about who we support and sponsor,” he said, adding that Perodua prefers to support individual sports such as golf and tennis. P2 has been backing badminton for some time now.\n\nClick to enlarge\n\nIf you’re wondering why Manchester United is going around with cap in hand, you might not realise that the club is a far cry from the all-conquering side (in both sporting and commercial terms) under Sir Alex Ferguson. United lost almost £300 million over the past three years and new co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is considering further redundancies at the club after already sacking 250 staff, plus ending Ferguson’s status as a paid ambassador.\n\nInfrastructure wise, Old Trafford, once the feared Theatre of Dreams, has of late made headlines for embarrassing things like a leaking roof and a rodent infestation – all while Ineos raised ticket prices and ended concessions for kids and pensioners. It’s reported that the club might even close their London office in Kensington to cut costs.\n\nIt’s not looking good on the pitch as well. After paying Sporting Lisbon £11 million to bring in Ruben Amorim (they also had to pay the sacked Erik ten Hag £10.4 million in compensation) mid-season, the Portuguese coach has won 10 and lost eight of his 20 games at the wheel (anyone missing Ole?). The Red Devils are currently 13th in the English Premier League.\n\nLooking to sell your car? Sell it with Carro.",

        "published_date": "Unknown",
        "content": "Red Bull team boss Christian Horner believes Formula 1's governing body the FIA was right to part ways with steward Johnny Herbert.\n\nOn Wednesday the FIA stated that Herbert, a long-time driver steward as the veteran of 160 grand prix starts, would no longer act as a steward at race weekends.\n\nThe FIA felt Herbert's media activities, especially those as a pundit for gambling websites, were incompatible with the role of a steward.\n\n“Johnny is widely respected and brought invaluable experience and expertise to his role,\" the FIA communicated. \"However, after discussion, it was mutually agreed that his duties as an FIA steward and that of a media pundit were incompatible.\"\n\nRed Bull chief Horner, whose driver Max Verstappen was regularly at odds with Herbert last year, said the 60-year-old's removal was the correct decision, though refuting suggestions the four-time world champion had anything to do with the matter.\n\n\"Well, firstly, absolutely nothing to do with Max, but absolutely the right decision,\" Horner told Sky Sports F1 at the Autosport Awards in London. \"You cannot have stewards working in the media. You don't have it in the Premiership. You don't have any other form of professional sport. It's totally inappropriate.\n\n\"You're either on the sporting regulatory side or you're on the media side. You can't have a foot in both camps.\"\n\nOracle Red Bull Racing Team Principal Christian Horner Photo by: Red Bull Content Pool\n\nVerstappen's father Jos had also been critical of Herbert's dual roles, saying \"a steward shouldn't talk to the press at all\", while Herbert felt there was no conflict of interest between his different activities.\n\n\"I am Johnny Herbert the steward and the professional during a race weekend and Johnny Herbert a pundit at other times, who expresses what he thinks,\" he said in November. “When I do speak to people on a Monday or Tuesday that is outside my stewarding responsibilities.\"\n\nHerbert's dismissal for taking on punditry gigs further highlighted a desire by many in motorsport for FIA stewards to become full-time professionals instead of relying on part-time volunteers, a stance taken by McLaren CEO Zak Brown.\n\n\"To have part-time, unpaid stewards in a multi-billion-dollar sport where everything is on the line to make the right call... I don’t think we are set up for success by not having full-time stewards,\" Brown said at the Autosport Business Exchange: London.\n\n\"As far as paying for the stewards, this will probably be unpopular amongst my fellow teams. I'm happy if McLaren and all the racing teams contribute. It's so important for the sport. It can't be that expensive if everybody contributes. It's not going to break the bank.\"\n\nBrown also felt stewards should be given the scope to show more leniency as they interpret the racing rules, which came under intense scrutiny in 2024 as Verstappen and Lando Norris battled in Austin and Mexico.\n\n\"The individuals are fine but the rulebook is too restrictive,\" he added. \"I’d like us to take a step back, loosen it up. Have full-time stewards who can make more of a subjective decision of whether that was right or wrong.\"",

        "author": "Unknown",
        "published_date": "Unknown",
        "content": "What we've learned about Rachel Reeves's expenses - and the Labour response\n\n14 February 2025 Billy Kenber Politics investigations correspondent Sean Seddon BBC News\n\nReuters\n\nSince BBC News reported on Thursday that Rachel Reeves had exaggerated her online CV and had been investigated over her use of expenses while working at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS), Labour colleagues have mounted a robust defence of the chancellor. Sir Keir Starmer said she had \"dealt with any issues that arise\" from the questions about her CV, and Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Newsnight that she was doing a \"brilliant and difficult job\". But Labour figures have questioned our reporting on the expenses investigation, with one cabinet minister calling it totally inaccurate. Here we examine the key Labour responses and look at the evidence that supports our journalism.\n\nWhat did we reveal about Reeves's expenses?\n\nThe BBC News investigation revealed that concerns were raised about Reeves's expenses while working at HBOS between 2006 and 2009. A detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint was submitted, with dozens of pages of supporting documents including emails, receipts and memos. It accused Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was her boss, of using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\", with spending on events, taxis and gifts, including for each other. We have seen these documents and spoken to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues. The chancellor and her expenses before she became an MP\n\nWhat happened to the whistleblower's complaint?\n\nThe complaint led to an internal investigation by the bank's risk department. This was passed to internal audit, which reviewed the allegations and concluded that they were substantiated and there appeared to be evidence of wrongdoing by Reeves and her two colleagues, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation. What we have not been able to establish is what happened next and whether the bank ever reached a formal conclusion.\n\nHow are Labour defending Reeves?\n\nReeves has said she was not aware of an investigation or issue with her expenses and said she left the bank on good terms. She said her expenses had always been signed off in the proper way. The person who signed off her expenses, her boss, was also subject to the internal investigation. Other Labour figures have criticised BBC News's reporting on the story, with two MPs repeating similar attacks. On Friday, Science Secretary Peter Kyle told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the reporting was \"inaccurate\". Both he and Siobhain McDonagh, a Labour MP who appeared on BBC's Politics Live on Thursday, raised comments by a former HR manager, Jane Wayper - which, they said, disproved the BBC News's story.\n\nEPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock Science Secretary Peter Kyle has criticised the BBC's reporting on Rachel Reeves\n\nWhat did the HR manager say?\n\nWayper spoke to the BBC after being given permission to do so by Reeves's team. She provided an on-the-record statement which said she \"would have been made aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" on the basis that she \"would have been required to organise and oversee a disciplinary process\". However, the BBC has not reported that the case reached a formal conclusion, or that there was disciplinary action. Kyle incorrectly claimed that the quote had not been included in our report - but it had been in the article since it was first published on Thursday morning. He also incorrectly referred to Wayper as the head of HR at the bank. In reality she was an HR business partner working in the department where Reeves worked.\n\nWhat has Reeves said?\n\nOn Friday, Reeves was asked about the expenses claims directly. She said: \"No-one ever raised any concerns about my expenses when I worked for Halifax Bank of Scotland.\" She said her expenses had been \"signed off in the proper way\" and \"no issues were ever raised\" during her time at the bank. Her expenses were signed off by her manager, who was also one of the three employees who were the subject of the expenses probe. Reeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.

        "content": "Syria is open to allowing Russia to hold onto two key military bases after Bashar Assad's ousting.\n\nSyria's new defense minister said that relations with Russia, which supported Assad, have improved.\n\nHmeimim and Tartus bases are strategic for Russia, offering major air and naval advantages.\n\nSyria is open to allowing Russia to keep hold of its two military bases in the country, two months after rebel groups ousted Kremlin ally Bashar Assad and set in motion a Russian troop and military equipment withdrawal.\n\nIn an interview with the Washington Post, Syrian Defense Minister Murhaf Abu Qasra said that there is a possibility Russia could hold onto the bases — Hmeimim air base and Tartus port — \"if we get benefits for Syria out of this.\"\n\nIt's not clear what military, economic, or political support could be offered, but Abu Qasra said that Russia's stance had \"improved significantly\" toward the new government.\n\nAssad, who ruled Syria for 24 years, fled to Russia in early December after a lightning two-week military campaign by rebel forces.\n\nThis threw Russia's hold on the bases — described by Andreas Krieg, a Gulf specialist at the Institute of Middle Eastern Studies at King's College London, as Russia's \"most important bases outside the direct sphere of Russian influence\" — into question.\n\nRussia was granted a 49-year lease on the bases in 2017 in return for military assistance.\n\nAt the end of January, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov said that \"nothing has changed\" and that preserving Russian access to the bases \"requires additional negotiations,\" according to Russian state-controlled news agency TASS.\n\nPrior to his ousting, Assad had enjoyed strong military and political support from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who stationed troops there and helped suppress rebel areas and a 2015 uprising with air and missile strikes.\n\nWithin days of Assad's removal, satellite images picked up a flurry of Russian activity at the bases: equipment being packed up, ships moving in and out of port, and the likely transfer of soldiers.\n\nIn January, Ukraine said that Russia was moving military gear from Tartus to Libya, where it also has a strong influence.\n\nThe Syrian bases are a key foothold in the Middle East and beyond for Russia.\n\nHmeimim affords Russian air forces a base for refueling and overflight for much of Africa. Tartus, on the Mediterranean, is unique in Russia's assets in being its only warm-water port with direct access to the oceans.\n\nThe rebel groups now governing Syria were previously targetted by Russian forces, but Abu Qasra told the Post, \"in politics, there are no permanent enemies.\"\n\nOne trump card held by Russia is Assad himself. According to the Post, the new Syrian government wants Assad's extradition so that he can be held to account for his bloody rule.",

I’m grateful to work alongside some of the finest journalists anywhere.”\n\nSpiegel most recently serves as FT’s U.S. managing editor, overseeing editorial operations in the Americas over the past nearly six years, including its expansion strategy and coverage as well as daily news operations for print and online.\n\nDuring his tenure, the publication won six Gerald Loeb Awards and 13 British Press Awards, including News Website of the Year in 2017 and Newspaper of the Year in 2018. He also served as the head of FT’s London newsroom and its Brussels bureau chief and a Washington business correspondent, leading coverage on the Justice Department, the Federal Communications Commission and other federal regulatory agencies, with a special focus on corporate crime, including its coverage of the Enron scandal.\n\nAdditionally, he held various reporting positions at The Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal from 2006 to 2010, covering foreign policy and military affairs with a special focus on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, frequently traveling overseas and visiting the war zones. Spiegel began his career as a reporter for Roll Call and Forbes Magazine.\n\n“Peter brings brilliant experience, digital expertise, management chops and a great nose for big stories and areas of opportunity,” Murray added. “He will be central as we shape the next great chapter for The Washington Post.”\n\nSpiegel’s appointment comes as the Post has seen several staffers depart after its billionaire owner Jeff Bezos nixed the editorial board’s plan to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for president before the 2024 election — marking the first time in 36 years the paper didn’t endorse a presidential candidate.\n\nThose who have exited include democracy editor Griff Witte, columnists Jen Rubin and Michele Norris, cartoonist Ann Telnaes, editor Philip Rucker, investigative reporter Josh Dawsey, political correspondents Ashley Parker and Michael Scherer and White House reporter Tyler Pager.\n\nAdditionally, WaPo laid off roughly 100 employees earlier this month.",

        "content": "Preparations are well underway for the 75th edition of the Berlinale\n\nBy Femke COLBORNE and Adam PLOWRIGHT\n\nThe Berlin Film Festival, which begins this week, is set for a challenge faced by the entire Western arts industry: how to stop politics from taking over the conversation.\n\nThe first major European film festival of the year saw its 2024 edition overshadowed by a row about Israel's bombardment of Gaza that left a mark on many filmmakers.\n\nThis year, Germany's national election -- which polls suggest could see unprecedented gains for the far-right AfD party -- falls on the final Sunday of the festival on February 23.\n\nThe festival's new director Tricia Tuttle said the Berlinale would not \"shy away\" from current events, but she hoped they would not entirely eclipse the on-screen stories.\n\n\"For all festivals and all culture right now, the news agenda can often dominate the discourse,\" she added as she presented this year's lineup on January 21.\n\n\"But we really hope that the films that audiences are going to see over the next weeks of the festival are going to get people talking about the vibrancy of the art form itself and the films themselves.\"\n\nThat may be the stated aim, but the opening night on Thursday will pitch the festival firmly into political territory with a film that touches on one of Germany's most sensitive issues -- immigration.\n\n\"Das Licht\" (\"The Light\") by German director Tom Tykwer features a middle-class German family whose lives are transformed by their mysterious Syrian housekeeper.\n\nThe mass arrival of Syrian refugees and other migrants in Germany in 2015-16 has helped fuel support for the AfD, which is forecast to emerge as one of the biggest parties nationally according to polls.\n\nLast year, organizers made headlines by barring five previously invited AfD politicians and telling them they were \"not welcome\".\n\n\"It would be nice if the main talking points were the films that are going to be shown, but I don't think that's the world we live in right now,\" Scott Roxborough, The Hollywood Reporter's European bureau chief, told AFP.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and his radical rightwing agenda are on everyone's minds, he said, as well as AfD-backing Elon Musk and the rise of artificial intelligence.\n\n\"There is definitely a general angst around AI in particular in the film industry,\" Roxborough added.\n\nThe selection of films set for Berlin stays true to the festival's mission of showcasing independent arthouse filmmakers from around the world, with a sprinkling of A-listers.\n\nHollywood director Richard Linklater's latest movie starring Ethan Hawke \"Blue Moon\" is in official competition, 11 years after Linklater won Berlin's Silver Bear for Best Director for \"Boyhood\".\n\nSouth Korean director Bong Joon-ho will present his new film \"Mickey 17\" with Robert Pattinson out of competition, while British actor Tilda Swinton will receive a lifetime achievement award.\n\nJessica Chastain, Marion Cotillard and Timothee Chalamet will add some stardust, while the jury is helmed by American director Todd Haynes.\n\nTuttle took up her job running the Berlinale in April last year, arriving with a reputation burnished by her time as head of the growing London Film Festival.\n\nThe American admitted that her first year had been \"challenging\" following controversy linked to criticism of Israel over its war in Gaza at the awards ceremony in 2024.\n\nUS filmmaker Ben Russell, wearing a Palestinian scarf, accused Israel of committing \"genocide\", while Palestinian filmmaker Basel Adra said the Gaza population was being \"massacred\".\n\nA spokeswoman for the German government, a staunch ally of Israel, and Berlin's mayor condemned the remarks afterwards as \"unacceptable\".\n\nTuttle admitted that the criticism had led some filmmakers to worry about whether they could exercise their right to freedom of expression.\n\nOne independent film producer told AFP on condition of anonymity that some directors had decided not to return until they had seen how Tuttle manages the issue.\n\nThe 2025 festival is set to screen a new documentary about an Israeli actor taken hostage by Hamas, as well as Claude Lanzmann's monumental 1985 epic on the Holocaust, \"Shoah\", which is more than nine hours long.\n\n\"Berlin has always been a place of big political discussion,\" Roxborough said.\n\n© 2025 AFP",

Essentially, Elon wants the memo field on government checks filled out. There is no reason for this, either for the code or the rationale, if you believe (modulo cases of fraud) that all that is required to issue a check is Congressional appropriation (i.e., a statute) or agency approval, as has hitherto been the case. The obvious reason for this architectural change to Treasury’s outputs is to bolt or kludge a second processor onto the existing back-end of the payments system, which would serve as a filter. This second processor would take existing outputs as input, but the “reporting changes” would enable the Executive to filter for checks based on the category or the rationale (or, for that matter, on the SSN; why not?), and then impound (not output) them. A less obvious reason is for future integration into “the blockchain,” perhaps “a bad idea whose time has come.” An even less obvious reason is to alter the checks: If you want to reduce Federal Spending by 20%, have the filter reduce the amount of every check by 20%.

        "content": "The Irish ambassador in London personally approved a book launch for ex-housing minister Eoghan Murphy, saying it would help demonstrate “the challenges faced by political officeholders” in the modern world.\n\nThe state-funded event, which was described as “grotesque” by one opposition TD, was hailed by Eoghan Murphy’s team as a “superbly well-­organised and joyful event”.\n\nAn email said the former Fine Gael minister was a “very happy author” with gratitude extended to “the whole gang, from Guinness pourers, black pudding canape deliverers to front of staff welcomers”.\n\nAn event approval form said the estimated cost would be GB£2,614 and it would help illustrate the “challenges faced by politicians in tackling their remit”.\n\nIt was organised after publishers Eriu directly contacted the Irish ambassador Martin Fraser in August letting them know about the imminent publication of Running from Office, which was described as a “remarkably well-written and compelling book that deserves to be read by everyone interested in politics”.\n\nMr Fraser responded in early September, saying the embassy would be “very happy” to work with the publisher on the UK launch.\n\nHe wrote: “As well as the obvious Irish dimension, we would hope the event could enable us to reach a wider audience in London with an interest in politics, and in particular the very topical issue of the challenges faced by political officeholders at this time.”\n\nEoghan Murphy. Photo: PA\n\nToday's News in 90 seconds - 2nd February 2025\n\n​Mr Fraser became Irish ambassador in 2022, after having spent more than a decade as secretary general at the Department of the Taoiseach.\n\nAn official form said the event would be held in the ballroom in Grosvenor Place, London, with around 120 guests expected.\n\nIn discussions with the publisher, the Irish Embassy said it would favour a reading and an “in-conversation” piece, followed by a reception.\n\nBy mid-November, broadcaster Ryan Tubridy had been confirmed as host and publishers told embassy staff the book was Ireland’s number one non-fiction title. An email from the embassy said: “That’s great news, on both counts! And should make for a great event here, too!”\n\nThe event caused controversy in Ireland, with People before Profit TD Ruth Coppinger saying it was “grotesque” and showed there was an inside track in public life.\n\nAt the time, the department said the event had cost just over GB£2,000. However, in response to a query under Freedom of Information, it said the final bill had come to £2,614, the equivalent of just over €3,000.\n\nAn information note said: “The total final bill… has been calculated based on more up-to-date unit costs which reflect inflation in 2024.\n\n“As the embassy hosts many events per year and supplies are purchased in bulk, these costs are based on the average consumption per event.”",

        "author": "Unknown",
        "published_date": "Unknown",

(2009)\n\nアメリカ人はしばしば世界の他の地域の人々と政治の話をすることに困難を覚える。2005年12月末に世界中のニュースワイヤーから多かれ少なかれ無作為に抜粋した3つの引用を見てみよう。ボリビアでは、新たに大統領に選出されたエボ・モラレスが「国民は新自由主義者を打ち負かした」と宣言し、「私たちは新自由主義モデルを変えたい」と付け加えた。ドイツでは、ロタール・ビスキーが、新政党の結成が「新自由主義が社会的結束に与えるダメージに対抗する民主的な代替案を生み出すことに貢献する」こと期待すると発表した。同じ頃、あるパン・アフリカ主義のウェブジャーナルが、「モーリシャス、スワジランド、マリといった遠く離れた国々からの新自由主義に代わる経済についての議論の高まりを反映した」特集号を発表した。[1]\n\nこれらはたった3つだが、容易に何十も見つけることができるだろう。地球上のほとんどの地域で、新自由主義はよく知られた言葉だ。新自由主義についての議論は、日常的な政治的会話の材料となっている。政治家は、新自由主義者であるとか、新自由主義的なアジェンダを追求していると非難され、野党候補は新自由主義に反対することで当選する（が、その後多くの場合、新自由主義に屈したとして元支持者から非難される）。新自由主義は世界の支配的なイデオロギー勢力と見做されている。世界に唯一残された超大国である米国が自国の社会・経済モデルを世界に拡大する試みだというのである。それは避けられないことであり、望ましいとさえ言う者もいれば、それに抗う運動もある。しかし、ほとんどの人がこれに対して意見を持っているのだ。\n\nアメリカではこの言葉を聞くことは少ない。学者や国際問題担当者を除くほとんどの人に対して、この言葉を口にしても虚な視線を向けられるだろう。実のところ、同じ問題について話そうとすれば、自由貿易、自由市場改革、グローバリゼーションといった明らかなプロパガンダ用語に頼らざるを得ない。最初の２つにおけるバイアスは明らかだ。中立であろうとするならば、頭に自由という言葉は付けないものである。グローバリゼーションはもう少しだけ微妙だ。何かを「新自由主義」と呼ぶときに言っているのは、それが経済を構築する最良の方法に関する数ある理論のうちの一つの思想体系にすぎないということである。それとは対照的に、「グローバリゼーション」は常に必然的なものとして扱われている。明日太陽が昇るかについて意見を持つのはあまり意味がないのであると、おそらくアメリカで最も著名な新自由主義の擁護者であるトーマス・フリードマンは主張する（が、もちろん彼がその言葉を挙げることはない）。それを現実として受け入れ、その中で最善を尽くすしかないというのだ。[2] とにかくグローバリゼーションは起こった。誰の責任でもない。インターネットが何か関係しているかもしれない。いずれにせよ、今や私たちは皆、適応するしかないのだ。\n\n新自由主義を単に米国が自国のモデルを世界に押し付けているに過ぎないと感じている人からみれば、これら全ては完全に予想通りであろう。しかし、公平を期すと、ほとんどのアメリカ人が新自由主義という言葉を紛らわしいと感じるもっと無邪気な理由はたくさんある。米国では政治用語の発達が他の国々と大きく異なっている。例えば、19世紀には、リベラルという言葉は私有財産権を基礎とする個人の自由を信じる人々に対して用いられていた。これらの「古典的リベラル」とも呼ばれる人々は、個人的な問題と同様に、経済に対する政府の干渉を拒否する傾向があった。これは今でも世界のほとんどの国でリベラルが意味することである。しかし、米国では20世紀を通じて、この言葉は穏健左派によって採用され、「社会民主主義者」のような意味を持つようになった。1980年代から、右派はリベラルという言葉を非難の言葉に変えることで対抗した。リベラルは、多くの労働者階級のアメリカ人の心の中で、ラテを啜る文化エリート主義者、「課税と支出」の政治家、同性婚の推進者、そして同様の忌み嫌われる人々の呼称となった。一方、自由市場の熱狂的な支持者たち、つまり世界では「リベラル」と呼ばれている人たちは、新しい呼び名を探し始めた。結局彼らが最終的に決めた名前はリバタリアンで、それは左派から借用した用語であった。その結果、アメリカ人が政治について他国の人と話すことはさらに難しくなった。他の国々では、リバタリアンという言葉はアナーキストの同義語として伝統的な意味をほとんど残しているからだ。ヨーロッパや南米では、「リバタリアン的共産主義」について語ることは全く珍しくない。これは、国家を解体し、経済生活のコントロールを民主的に組織された共同体の手に委ねるべきだという考え方である。平均的な米国市民の前でこのような言葉を使えば、意図的な矛盾で他人を混乱させるのが好きな迷惑な人、あるいは狂った人だと思われるだろう。\n\n人々が相互に話すことができないのはいいことではあり得ないし、多くのアメリカ人が、世界における自分たちの役割に対する怒りが広がっていることに戸惑っているように見える今は特に残念なことだ。報道では、新自由主義への反対、特にラテンアメリカでの反対は、あたかも新自由主義が本当にアメリカの生活様式と単純に同一であるかのように、しばしば「反米主義」と呼ばれる。実際には、そうではない。実際、アメリカ人の大多数は新自由主義の核となる考え方や制度を否定しているという主張は十分に成り立つし、アメリカ人は実に、新自由主義的な「改革」の最初の犠牲者だ。それらは本巻で述べられている多くの不安定要因の究極的な原因となっている政策の数々である。アメリカ人も新自由主義に反対する世界的な運動の高まりの中で重要な役割を果たしてきたのは確かなのだ。\n\n上記が示唆するように、私はここで中立性を主張しているわけではない。世界的な貧困の根源や資本主義の本質について「客観的」あるいは「科学的」な説明をしていると主張する人は、よほど世間知らずか、何かを売りつけようとしているかのどちらかだと言っていいと思う。\n\n新自由主義の根源\n\n経済理論および政治理論としての新自由主義は、いくつかの比較的単純な前提に基づいている。最小限の概略は次のようなものだ。\n\n政府は経済への関与を最小限にとどめるべきである。さらに、政府には大規模な工業・商業企業を経営する能力はない。実際には、市場環境の中で利潤を追求して活動する民間企業は、公的機関よりも上手く公共サービスを提供することが常に期待できる。したがって政府は、民間企業が公共サービスを提供しやすい法的環境を整え、必要なインフラを整備することに専念するべきである。 貿易障壁を減らすことは常にいいことであり、常にすべての人に利益をもたらす。旧態依然とした保護主義的な政策は捨てるべきである。各国が自律的に発展しようとするのではなく、単一のグローバル市場において特定の「競争的優位性」（それが安価な労働力であれ、教育を受けた労働力であれ、天然資源であれ）を追求するべきである。 貧しい人々を利する政府の支出政策は、それが基本的な食料品の価格支持であれ、医療サービスの無料提供であれ、年金基金の保証であれ、究極的には逆効果である。それらは縮小されるか廃止されるべきである。市場の働きを歪めてしまうからだ。その代わり、自国通貨の安定を保証するために政府が支出を制限して均衡財政を維持すれば、外国からの投資に有利な市場環境が生まれ、市場そのものがこれらの問題のより良い解決策を提供する。\n\n1980年代以降、世界のほとんどすべての国が何らかの新自由主義改革を採用してきた。しかし、政治家がそのようにすると約束して当選したことが理由であるのは例外的だ。間違いなく、最初の新自由主義的実験は1970年代半ばにチリで、選挙で選ばれた政府を軍事クーデターで転覆させた後に将軍アウグスト・ピノチェトによって実施された。しかし、ほとんどの改革は武力による強制ではなく、財政的強制とでも呼ぶべきものであった。\n\nデヴィッド・ハーヴェイが指摘するように、真の転換点は、1975年に始まったニューヨーク市の金融危機である。[3] これは少し詳しく検討する価値がある。危機は市が財政破綻の瀬戸際に立たされている状態から始まった。連邦政府が救済措置を拒否し、投資銀行が債務のロールオーバーを拒否したため、ニューヨークは技術破産に追い込まれた。債権者たちはその後、市政府から独立した、つまり有権者に責任を負わされない、市政府援助公社（Municipal Assistance Corporation, MAC）と呼ばれる組織の設立を進め、市を救済する条件として市の政治的景観を作り替え始めた。当時のニューヨークはアメリカにおける社会民主主義の飛地のようなものだったことを忘れてはならない。全米で最も広範な家賃統制だけでなく、アメリカで最も労働組合が組織され、最も広範な公共サービスが提供され、唯一の無料の公立大学さえ維持されていた。予算を均衡させるという名目で、MACは自治体の労働組合の力を削ぎ、サービスを削減し、年金や雇用保証を後退させ、企業や開発業者に莫大な減税を提供し、市政のあり方そのものを再構築し始めた。\n\nまず第一に、市政がすべての市民のために平等に存在するという建前がなくなった。むしろ、市は売り込むべき商品だった。ロゴとジングルが発明された（ビッグ・アップル、アイ・ラブ・ニューヨーク）。市の中心部がそれ自身の煌びやかな広告塔として再建されるにつれ、貧困層は潜在的な観光客や投資家の目から遠ざけられることになった。消防隊の計画的な撤退により、サウスブロンクスやイースト・ニューヨークのような周辺地域は焼け野原と化した。アウター・ボローズの労働者階級にとって重要な、地下鉄のようなインフラは崩壊するままにされた。ニューヨーク市立大学は授業料を徴収せざるを得なくなった。同時に、市政府は投資家にとってより良い「ビジネス環境」を作ることを目的とした、ジェントリフィケーションキャンペーンや市中心部の新しい通信インフラ構築の支援に資金を注ぎ込んだ。\n\n1970年代後半から1980年代前半のニューヨークといえば、スタジオ54でコカインを嗅ぐ享楽的なヤッピーのイメージか、あるいは都市崩壊のイメージを思い浮かべるのが普通だ。グラフィティ、クラックハウス、ホームレスの蔓延など、当時はカルカッタやボンベイと比較された。こうしたイメージを可能にした貧富の差の拡大は、しばしば弁明者たちが主張するように、脱工業化や通信・サービス産業の成長の必然的な結果ではなかった。それらはニューヨーク市民の総意が選択したわけでもなく、また選択するはずもなかったであろう政治的判断の結果だ。公共財という考え方に哲学的に反対する金融業者によって事実上押し付けられたのである。しかし、その結果、新自由主義的倫理とでも呼ぶべきものが徐々に出現した。それは富裕層には個人の自己実現を、貧困層には「個人の責任」を同時に強調する。どちらも、民主主義が共同体に対する何らかの共通の献身を意味する（ましてや、共同体の構成員が共同体の民主的な生活に参加するために最低限必要なもの、食料、住居、自由な時間へのアクセスを保証されるべきである）という考え方の否定に依存しているように思われた。それを明言した数少ない政治家の一人であるマーガレット・サッチャーは、最も簡潔に次のように述べた。「社会というものは存在しない。」個人がいて、家族がいて、彼らの独立した利己的な決断の結果が民主的な選択なのだ。コミュニティが呼び起こされるとしたら、「アイ・ラブ・ニューヨーク」キャンペーンのように、単なるセールスギミックにすぎない。結局のところ、新自由主義の世界では売れるものすべてが現実そのものなのだから。自己のマーケティング能力以外に何も残されていない断片化された個人の感覚は当時の新興文化のあらゆるレベルに響いていた。ニューヨークのアートシーンの洗練されたポストモダニズムから、広告代理店によって識別されターゲットにされた消費者のアイデンティティの果てしない細分化まで。\n\nニューヨークの歴史は、政治家が地域社会と対立して当選することは滅多にないことを示すだけでなく [4]、いったん社会的トリアージのプロセスが既成事実として受け入れられてしまえば、政治家はしばしば、そのような政策が必ず巻き起こす混乱や暴力から中産階級や労働者階級の市民を守ると約束し、法と秩序を掲げて選挙に勝つことができることも示している。1990年代のニューヨークでのルドルフ・ジュリアーニの当選は、単に暴力と犯罪に執着する政治への長い退化の集大成に過ぎず、本質的には、1970年代の混乱の後始末をすることが目的であった。このパターンは世界各地の都市で何度も何度も再現されることになった。\n\n1980年代、第三世界の債務危機によって、レーガン政権は同じモデルを世界規模で適用し始めた。その債務危機の起源は、1970年代後半の石油輸出機構（OPEC）の石油禁輸に遡る。基本的に起こったことといえば、原油価格の高騰でOPEC諸国が突然大量の資金を手にし、すぐに、（その資金が投資されていた）欧米の銀行は資金の借り手を見つけられなくなったことである。その結果、「ゴーゴー・バンキング」の時代が到来し、銀行の担当者は世界中を飛び回り、その後に起こるであろう経済的大当たりの荒唐無稽な予測に基づいて、第三世界の指導者たちに高利融資を受け入れるよう積極的に説得しようとした。この資金の大部分は単に盗まれた。残りの多くは、（世界銀行を有名にした巨大なダムの数々など）誤った考えの壮大なプロジェクトに投資され、後に政府主導の開発という考えそのものの愚かさを示すために利用された。言うまでもなく、数年以内に多くの貧しい国々がデフォルトの瀬戸際に立たされた。この時点で、米国財務省は国際通貨基金（IMF）と緊密に協力し、いかなる場合にもこのような債務を償却しないという方針を固めた。[5] これは、お金の貸し手が一定のリスクを負うことを当然とするそれまでの経済学的正統性からの大きな逸脱であることを付言しておく。これは新自由主義の重要な要素を示している。貧困層は（現実のものであれ想像上のものであれ）不適切な経済的決断の責任を問われるが、富裕層は決して責任を問われないということだ。実質的な効果として、全額がスイスの個人銀行口座に直接振り込まれる可能性が高いことを十分承知していながら、銀行家が汚職に手を染めた独裁者に1億ドルを貸したとすると、たとえその独裁者がその後民衆の反乱によって追放されたとしても世界政府と金融機関の全機構が歩調を合わせ、独裁者のかつての犠牲者たちから寛大な金利で資金を回収できると主張することを銀行家は安心していられるのである。そのために何千人もの人が飢えなければならなくなったとしても、それは仕方のないことなのだ。\n\n革新的だったのは、単に債務の不可侵性を主張するだけでなく、ニューヨークのように債務を政治的手段として利用したことだ。[6] 融資はすぐに返済不能となり、借り換えを余儀なくされた。しかし、IMFがそうする前に、各国政府は新自由主義的なエコノミストたちによって考案された「構造調整プログラム」と呼ばれるものを受けることに同意しなければならなかった。彼らの最優先事項は常に財政均衡であり、それは表向きには安定した通貨と有利な投資環境を作り出すためだった。これは、最も劇的なものでは、燃料や基本的な食料品に対する価格支持の撤廃や、医療施設や初等教育のようなそれまで無料であったサービスに対する「利用者負担」の賦課など、社会サービスの削減によって主に行われた。これに伴い、公的資源を売却し、国内市場を外国貿易と投資に全面的に解放することになっていた。想像に難くないが、こうした政策は都市部の貧困層から絶えず反発を招いた。しかし、各国政府は選択の余地はなかったと言うことができた。それは正しかった。貧困国の指導者たちがIMFの協定への署名を真っ向から拒否した数少ない場面、例えば、1990年代初頭のマダガスカルの大統領アルベール・ザフィがそうだったが、彼らは、そうしなくては他のすべての国々が援助を打ち切ることになることをすぐに知った。援助がなければ民間資本は撤退し、保険補助がなければ製品を輸出することさえできなかった。効果は、少なくとも純粋に経済的荒廃という点では、小規模な核攻撃で達成されたかもしれないものとほぼ同等であった。[7]\n\n1980年代と1990年代はもちろん、ヨーロッパ、アフリカ、アメリカ大陸の大部分で独裁政権が選挙で選ばれた政府に取って代わられた時期だ。しかし、有権者は自分たちの選択が経済政策にほとんど何の影響も及ぼさないことをすぐに知ることになった。それは、同時に経済的な決定のレバーが政府の手から離れ、選挙で選ばれたわけでもない、説明責任のない新自由主義的テクノクラートの手に渡ったからである。これは負債によってのみ起きたのではない。この時代のもう一つの典型は、貿易協定を執行するための機関に経済問題の管轄権が移ったことである。例えば、1994年の北米自由貿易協定（NAFTA）の調印は、特には、革命の主要な遺産の一つであった集団エヒードを含むあらゆる形態の共同体的土地所有権の廃止を含む大規模な憲法改正をメキシコに約束させたが、この問題が選挙民の前に現れることはなかった。[8] ヨーロッパでは、EUの協定が同様の役割を果たし、ヨーロッパの新しい共通通貨の安定を維持するための財政均衡の名の下に、社会的な保護を撤廃し「柔軟な」労働体制を導入することを各国政府に強制した。その後すぐに、関税及び貿易に関する一般協定（GATT）、そして世界貿易機関（WTO）と、同様の貿易協定が世界中に拡大した。いずれの場合も、任命された官僚の組織が、労働条件や環境を保護するための法律を含め、過度に保護主義的と見做される法律を取り締まる権限を与えられていた。\n\n最も劇的だったのは東ヨーロッパと中欧ヨーロッパの事例であろう。1989年と1991年に共産主義が崩壊した直後に行われた調査では、ほとんどの国民が北欧風の社会福祉国家の創設を希望し、社会主義の維持に賛成する国民は極少数あり、純粋な自由市場モデルの導入に賛成する国民はほとんどいなかった。にもかかわらず、選挙で選ばれた政府が発足するやいなや彼らは一様に、まさにそのモデルをできる限り早く導入するために、外国で考案された「ショック療法」プログラムを実施し始めた。これらの国々はほとんどの場合、多額の負債を負っていなかったため、なおさら印象的であった。その頃には、それ以外の条件では世界経済との完全な統合は不可能になっていたようだ。[9]\n\n実際、1990年代には、新自由主義の方針に基づいて運営されるグローバル統治システムについて確信を持って語ることができるようになった。それは一連の階層から構成されることを想像してほしい。最上位にいるのは金融取引業者だ。ここ数十年の大きな革新の一つは、金融資本が巨大な花を咲かせたことである。現在の時点で、グローバル市場と呼ばれるものにおける経済取引の90%以上はもはやいかなる種類の商品の製造や取引とも直接の関係はなく、単に通貨取引やその他の形態の金融投機で成り立っている。トーマス・フリードマンが好んで呼ぶ「電子的な群れ」は、新自由主義の正統性を裏切っていると見做される「新興市場」から即座に資金を引き揚げることができるため、これは巨大な規律メカニズムとして機能する。このような通貨流出の影響は、繰り返しになるが、核爆発に匹敵するような意味合いを持つ。次の階層は多国籍企業で、その収入はほとんどの国のGDPをはるかに上回ることが多い。1980年代から1990年代にかけて、新聞社からデパート、建設会社まで、かつては独立していた何千もの企業が官僚主義的な路線で組織された巨大コングロマリットに吸収された。次に、IMF、WTO、EU、東南アジア諸国連合（ASEAN）、NAFTA、さまざまな準備銀行など、種々の通商官僚機構である。これらの官僚機構のエコノミストたちは、多国籍企業に従順な政策を主張するために、定期的に金融業者の脅威を喚起している。結局、非政府組織（NGO）が際限なく発展し、小児予防接種から農業融資まで、以前は国家政府の仕事と考えられていたサービスを提供するようになった。世界の金融取引の大部分を行う巨大な証券会社やヘッジファンドを含み、これらの階層はすべて、合わせて一つの巨大な、事実上の管理システムを構成している。これは人類史上初めての、実際に惑星規模の決定を執行する力を持つ行政システムである。結局のところ、全世界にまたがる帝国など存在したことはないし、最初の真のグローバル機関である国連も道徳的権威以上のものを持ったことはなかったからだ。階層的に組織化された大規模な行政システムを指す言葉はもちろんある。それは官僚機構と呼ばれている。この新しい行政システムの中で働く人々のほとんどが自分たちを官僚だと思いたがらないことは確かだ。そして確かにこれらの組織は、それが（ほぼ）取って代わろうとした政府官僚組織よりもはるかに分散化され、柔軟なやり方で運営される傾向にある。[10] しかし、惑星全体に渡る貿易官僚機構が、わたしたちが最も慣れ親しんでいるものとは異なって組織されることは予想されることだ。注目すべきは、その独裁があまりにも効果的であるため、豊かな国に住む人々のほとんどがその存在に事実上気付いていないことだ。\n\n帳簿の均衡\n\n新自由主義改革の支持者たちは通常、自分たちの処方箋が、しばしば彼らが言うように「苦い薬」であること、あるいは少なくとも当初は、「痛みが伴う」ものであることを認めるのを厭わなかった。その正当化とは、ここでもまたマーガレット・サッチャーが最も簡潔に言ったことだが、「代替案はない」ということだった。社会主義的な解決策は失敗し、グローバルな競争がそのままである限り、他に方法はなかった。「資本主義」（暗に新自由主義的資本主義）は、上手く機能する唯一のものであることが証明されたのだ。このフレーズはそれ自体重要な意味を持つ。というのも、わたしたちがいかに徹底的に国家や社会を企業として捉えているかを示しているからである。「何を目的として上手く機能するのか」と問うことをほとんど誰も思いつかなかったようだ。とはいえ、新自由主義の成功はほとんど経済成長によってのみ測られるという新自由主義自らの観点で評価したとしても、世界規模で見れば、新自由主義は著しく失敗していることが証明されている。\n\nここで、「自由市場改革」が1960年代と1970年代の国家主導の開発戦略の欠点に対する反動であったはずであることを思い出してほしい。数字はこの通りだ。1960年代と1970年代の世界の成長率は、それぞれ年平均3.5%と2.4%だった。1980年代の新自由主義改革期には、この数字は1.4%に低下し、1990年代における新自由主義的な「ワシントン・コンセンサス」期には1.1%に低下した。[11] その影響は、「自由貿易」の最大の受益者であるはずの発展途上国においてはさらに劇的であった。中国を除けば、[12] 最初の20年間で、グローバル・サウスの一人当たりの実質国内生産成長率は全体として年率3.2%であり、実際、当時の世界平均よりも高かった。新自由主義時代（1981年〜99年）の間にこれは0.7%に低下した。[13] 実際には多くの経済は縮小した。さらに、低成長は必ずと言っていいほど、ますます不平等な分配を伴っていた。各国のエリートがグローバル都市の煌びやかな大都市に居を構え、あるいはイーサネットで結ばれたゲーテッド・コミュニティに閉じこもるようになると各国政府は、かつてはすべての国民に最低限の社会的保護を保障するはずだった政策へのいかなる関与も放棄した。その結果、国際NGOが被害を抑えようとした一方で、ニューヨークと同様、一種の社会的トリアージが行われ、政府の役割は主に、貧困層や新たに貧困に陥った人々を一掃し、人目につかないようにすることであった。世界規模で見れば、識字率や平均寿命といった社会指標全体が劇的に低下した。[14]\n\nこれが一般に知られた知識でないとすれば、それは新自由主義の支持者が決して全体像について語らないためでもある。勝ち組と負け組が存在するのがグローバル市場の本質だと彼らは言う。そして、自分たちのアドバイスに最も忠実に従った者が勝者であることを証明しようとする。それゆえ、リトアニアはロシアより、ウガンダはアンゴラより、チリはブラジルより上手くいっているのだと。これですら、通常はかなりの量の帳簿操作が必要である。例えば1980年代、改革派は韓国や台湾のような「アジアの虎」の成功を指摘したがった。そのためには、両者とも、新自由主義者たちが推奨していることとは基本的に正反対の、重関税、公教育への大規模な政府投資、さらには政府主導の産業五カ年計画に依存してきたと言う事実を軽く扱う必要があった。ヨーロッパでは、言うまでもなく自由市場改革に最も熱心だったイギリスが、今ではアイルランドより低い生活水準を維持している。一方、ヨーロッパ諸国の中で、経済の最も大きな割合を社会福祉事業に割り当てているフィンランドは、世界経済フォーラムによると、今や米国に代わって最も経済競争力のある国となっている。[15] 同時に、過去10年間の世界経済における二大勝者、米国と中華人民共和国は、IMFの助言を最も組織的に無視できる立場にある。例えば、アメリカではあまり知られていないが、IMFは毎年、米国政府の巨大な財政赤字を非難し、関税や農業補助金の削減を要求している。米国ではIMFは強制力を持たないため、政府はそれを無視するだけである。[16] 米国の最大の債権者である中国は、他の発展途上国に適用される「規律」のほとんどすべてを回避してきた。例えばブラジルと同じ立場であれば、産業インフラのための無限の信用供与、ましてや外国の特許や著作権を組織的に無視するような政策を維持することは許されなかっただろう。中国の華々しい経済的成功の要となったのは、間違いなくこれらの政策である。\n\nIMFのエコノミストたちはもりろん、各国が彼らの政策提言を採用すると、しばしば悲惨な結果を招くことを承知している。彼らの反応はいつも同じだ。もっと苦い薬が必要だ。\n\nフィリピンの経済学者ウォルデン・ベロが言うように、これは控えめに言っても不可解なことだ。これらのエコノミストのほとんどは、民間部門と幅広く仕事をしてきた。民間企業が経済戦略を提言してもらうためにコンサルタントを雇い、提言された戦略が示された目標への到達に完全に失敗した場合、そのコンサルタントは通常解雇されることが予想されることを彼らは知っている。少なくとも、彼には別の戦略を打ち出すことが求められるだろう。同じエコノミストたちが、目立った肯定的な結果が見られないなか、ウルグアイやマリのような国々が何十年も毎年同じ政策を続けるように主張するとき、彼らの頭の中でウルグアイやマリの最善の利益を第一に考えているのが本当か疑わざるを得ない。[17] ウルグアイとマリのほとんどの人が、かなり早い段階からそうではないとの結論に達していたのは確かだ。\n\nこの件に関しては、多くの憶測が飛び交っている。デヴィッド・ハーヴェイは、新自由主義は世界的繁栄の戦略としては非効率的であったとしても、1970年代に革命運動や民主化運動によって広く脅かされていた階級権力を強固なものにするという点では驚くほど効果的であったと指摘している。（これに付け加えると、新自由主義政策の最大の受益者は、新興行政機関の職員たち自身だ。）ベロ自身も似たような主張をしているが、地政学的な観点からである。1970年代末には、ブラジルのような国々が重要な産業大国として台頭し、南半球の経済的地位が急速に向上したため、非同盟運動における南半球の政治的代表者たちは、世界経済の構造そのものに変化を求め始めていた。OPECの石油禁輸措置は、このような新たな経済力の発揮の中で最も劇的な現れでしかなかった。そうだとすると、構造調整は攻勢を鈍らせ、南半球の多くの国々を貧困化した従属国に変えるのに極めて効果的であることが証明された。とはいえ、この視点は、米国が新自由主義的な政策を通じて、避けられない事態を先送りにしていただけなのではないかという興味深い問題を提起している。これは言い換えれば、イマニュエル・ウォーラーステインの見解であり、彼は、金融資本という仮想世界の裏側を覗けば、少なくとも1960年代以降、アメリカの経済力が世界の他の国々に対して低下し続けていることがわかると指摘する。その主な理由は、全体的な生産性の低さだと彼は主張する。米国は書類上、世界で最も生産性の高い労働力を持っているように見えるが、これは統計が賃金労働者（米国ではほとんどどこよりも搾取されている）の生産性だけを測定し、管理職の生産性を測定しないからである。乱暴にいえば、米国では、ヨーロッパや東アジアで一人の幹部がする仕事を2、3人の幹部がしており、そして米国の幹部は5、6倍の給料を要求する。ウォーラーステインによれば、米国が世界各地で推進した新自由主義的改革の主な効果の一つは、他国でも同様に寄生的な経営者層の誕生を促すことであり、その結果、少なくとも他国が追いつく速度を遅らせる効果があった。インドと中国の急速な台頭は、このゲームがもうすぐ終わることを示唆している。[18]\n\n哲学としての新自由主義\n\n私たちはパラドックスに直面している。急進的な個人主義の哲学が、なぜ世界初のグローバル行政官僚機構を創設する正当な理由となったのか？\n\nここで、私たちは19世紀に立ち戻らなければならないと思う。古い自由主義と新自由主義に共通点があるとすれば、それは第一に、両者とも人間の自由を個人の財産を享受する能力として捉えていたこと、第二に、それにもかかわらず、両者とも自らを人類の歴史における進歩的、革命的勢力とさえ考えていたことである。\n\nこのような主張の政治的背景を簡単に検討してみよう。1647年のパトニー討論において、クロムウェル軍の急進派が、「すべての人間は、彼自身の自然な流れと領域で、生まれながらにして王であり、聖職者であり、預言者であり、」政府を含め「何人も立ち入ることのできない」自己と財産の唯一の所有者であると主張したとき、これは非常に急進的な主張であった。[19] 200年後、それは明らかにそうではなくなっていた。その頃、労働者運動は私有財産の政治的権力に対する根本的な挑戦を始めていた。一方、リベラルは左派の中でも私有財産と、特に市場経済を擁護する傾向が強かった。\n\nこれは、19世紀のリベラルが、彼らが一般的に主張していたように急進派ではなく、左翼ですらなかったと言っているのではない。多くは奴隷制や軍国主義に真っ向から反対し、個人の権利や普通選挙権を支持する人々だった。自由市場の熱狂的支持者はまた、アダム・スミスにならって、大規模な特許会社を政府がもたらした独占、真の経済競争の抑制と見做す傾向があった。リベラルの理想は、自律した個人や小規模な家族経営の企業が、グローバルな市場で商品を売買する世界だった。当時の大英帝国に好意的な見方が多かったとすれば、それは帝国がある程度、これらの理想を実践していたからである。例えば、市場開放には武力を行使したが、自国ではあらゆる保護主義を拒否した。東インド会社のような特許独占企業は世紀の初頭に解体されていたため、当時のイギリスの資本主義は実際に比較的小規模な家族経営の企業によるところが大きかった。最終的には、産業革命がもたらしたあらゆる蛮行によって、リベラルには賃金労働でさえ自由の方向への進歩であると見做すことができた。それは、資本家がそれまで大きく依存しており、そして世界的に見ればある程度は常に依存してきたし今でも依存している、奴隷制、負債隷属制、そして強制労働や拘束労働に比べればである。\n\nアメリカの資本主義はイギリス以上にリベラルの理想に近い形で始まったが、1870年代から1880年代にかけては全く異なる方向に進み始めた。その重要な革新は近代的な株式会社を創設したことである。会社設立許可は、何千人もの従業員を抱える株式会社を、法的には個人として扱うことを可能にし得たが、19世紀の大半は、運河や鉄道の建設など、特定の公共サービスを提供できる立場にある、地方の実業家に対して、地方自治体が与える特権と考えられていた。1880年代から1890年代にかけて、企業は永続的な地位を獲得しただけでなく、国家の経済を支配するようになっていた。20世紀、アメリカは世界にまたがる多国籍企業を率先して設立した。ジョヴァンニ・アリギが指摘しているように、米国がイギリスに代わって世界の支配者となったとき、米国は独自の官僚主義的な資本主義を持ち込んだ。[20] そのバトンは第二次世界大戦後に正式に引き継がれ、ルーズベルト大統領が最初に行ったことの一つが、私が新興のグローバル官僚機構と呼んだものの最初の枠組みを作ることだった。これらは、会議が開催されたニューハンプシャー州のスキーリゾートにちなんで、ブレトンウッズ機関と呼ばれるようになった。IMF、世界銀行、そしてWTOの前身であるGATTである。形式的には、新しく創設された国際連合の法的枠組みの傘下にあったが、やがてグローバル行政の効果的なシステムとして国際連合を覆い隠すようになった。[21] アリギはまた、イギリスとは異なり、最も強力だった頃のアメリカは自由貿易に特に力を入れていたわけではなかったと指摘する。イングランドのように自国市場を開放することはなかった。現在でも、アメリカの庇護のもとで「国際貿易」として計上される取引のおよそ3分の1は、貿易ではなく、内部組織構造において旧ソ連の企業とほとんど見分けがつかないような企業の、異なる支店間の単なる移転である。[22]\n\nでは、第二波の自由主義はどのようにこの中にはまるのか。それはウォーラーステインが「1968年の世界革命」と呼ぶものの観点からのみ理解できるように思える。1960年代後半、工業化された世界を揺るがした暴動、蜂起、学生運動は、資本主義に対する反乱であったが、同時に資本家が同盟を結んでいた福祉国家に対する反乱でもあった。彼らはまた、当時の「まともな」マルクス主義的反対派とレーニン主義体制の両方との完全な決別を宣言する傾向があった。1968年5月のパリの反乱者たちはフランス共産党とは一切関わりたがらなかった。彼らの反乱は、あらゆる抑圧的な社会慣習や官僚的制約に対する個人の解放、喜び、自己表現の名の下に起こったものだった。そして、1968年のアメリカにおける精神も同様だった。1960年代後半に大学に通った世代が制度的権力を握り始めたまさにその瞬間に、新自由主義が支配的なイドオロギーになったというのは偶然とは思えない。イデオロギーとしては、19世紀の自由主義がやったことと全く同じことをするように意図されているようだ。それは、資本主義のために、革命的なエネルギー、アイデア、さらには革命的な言語を取り戻すことである。\n\nここで最も良い例は、資本主義という言葉自体の歴史だろう。新自由主義のレトリックの重要な要素は、資本主義自体が革命的な力であるという考えである。こうした言葉遣いは、実はかなり新しいものである。少なくとも資本主義者の言葉としては。資本主義者は歴史的に資本主義という言葉を一度も使ったことがなく、自由企業、起業家精神、民間企業、経済的自由といった言葉を好んで使ってきた。資本主義という言葉は、批評家たちが、生産的資産が少数の人間によって自分たちの利益のために支配されている、汚らしい経済現実と見做すものを表現するのにほぼ独占的に使われていた。一方、「社会主義」は、生産的資産が公共の利益のために民主的に管理される世界という実現されていない理想だった。新自由主義時代の最も特徴的な知的な動きはこれをひっくり返したことだった。資本主義は実現されない理想、つまり完全に自由で自己調整された市場というユートピア的な夢となった。社会主義は政府による規制の汚れた現実だった。したがって、人類の幸福と自由におけるすべての進歩は資本主義によるものであり、すべての悪は社会主義の長引く影響によるものであるとされる。\n\nこれは伝統的な資本主義のレトリックではなかった。むしろ、それは一種の逆マルクス主義であった。興味深いことに、この言葉遣いは主に反対側からの亡命者によって最初にされた。最も悪名高いのはロシアの亡命者アイン・ランドだ。1946年に最初に出版された彼女の著書『資本主義：知られざる理想』は、1987年から2006年までアメリカ連邦準備制度理事会の議長を務め、新自由主義正統派の真の最高司祭となる若きアラン・グリーンスパンに大きな影響を与えた。極右の言葉遣いとして始まったものが、すぐにほぼあらゆる場所で採用されるようになった。1980年代までに、再評価された資本主義という言葉は、左派よりとされるニューヨーク・タイムズの編集長によって特別な目的で採用されたようだ。この時期、同紙はおそらく少なくとも100の異なる見出しと社説を掲載し、左派政権または政党が「資本主義」を受け入れることを余儀なくされたと発表した。マルクス主義体制の崩壊後、タイムズ紙のコラムニストたちは資本主義が急進的な力であるという考えに夢中になり、同紙上ではチェ・ゲバラが生きていたなら、純粋な革命的熱意から自由市場の改革者になったかどうかについて活発な議論が繰り広げれられた。\n\nこの文脈でのみ、絶対的な個人主義のレトリックがどのようにして新興の官僚機構の基盤となったのかを理解できると私は思う。それは革命の言葉とともに慌ただしく息を切らしながら到来した。問題は、これが単なる言語ではなく、それが引き起こした革命的な側面が、ほとんどの場合、最も悲惨なものだったことだ。実際、新自由主義の立場の本質はスターリン主義と、というのは、1920年代と1930年代にマルクス主義革命家が官僚国家の創設を正当化するために使った議論まで、驚くほど類似している。これを次のように要約できるだろう。「科学は、前進できる道は一つしかないことを示している。それは地球上のどの社会でも同じである。これを理解し、社会を適切に再構築する力を与えられるべき、科学的に訓練されたエリートがいる。この科学の訓練を受けていない人々の経済的な見解は無意味である。だから黙って言われたことをすることだ。たとえ短期的にはこれが大きな苦痛と混乱、さらには飢餓と死を引き起こすかもしれないとしても、いつかは（いつになるかは分からないが）、すべてが平和と繁栄の楽園につながるからだ。」\n\n1930年代にソ連の官僚がロシアの農民に説いたのと同じ主張が、今ではほぼすべての人に説かれている。唯一の大きな違いは、今では歴史的唯物論がミルトン・フリードマン流の自由市場経済学に取って代わられたことだ。1989年以来、ポーランドからベトナムに至るまで、多くの紛れもないスターリン主義者の官僚が一つの正統派から別の正統派へと簡単に切り替えることができたのも驚くには当たらない。根本的な飛躍はほとんど必要なかったのだ。\n\n明らかに、新自由主義的なグローバル官僚機構は、ユートピア的ビジョンを押し付けようとする点で、旧共産主義の官僚機構ほど直接的には介入していない。しかし、人生のあらゆる側面を市場の論理に従わせるという究極の理想は、金融家のジョージ・ソロスのような離反者が好んで指摘するように、その野望においてはむしろ、同等に全体主義的である。さらに、その効果の多くは不思議なほど類似している。ソビエト政権下では、イデオロギーの議論は言うまでもなく、政治生活は非合法だった。すべての政治的問題は解決済みとされた。残るのは、最終的には消費者の楽園を創り出すことを目指していることになっている、経済行政だけであった。その結果、中央に対して政治的主張ができる唯一の方法は、何らかの民族的、または文化的アイデンディティを主張することだった。例えば、カザフ人が原子力発電所を手に入れるとなれば、私たちウズベク人もそれを手に入れる資格があるはずだというように。アイデンティティ・ポリティクスは官僚機構が受け入れ可能と判断した唯一のものだった。その結果、これらの国家が解体すると、多くの国家が即座に民族間の戦争に陥った。かなり似たようなことが現在世界規模で起こっていることは明らかだ。特に共産主義の崩壊は、イデオロギー的、つまり政治的な議論が終わったことを意味すると解釈された。その結果、アイデンディティ・ポリティクスは正当であると見做されるだけでなく、非常に現実的な意味で完全に正当であると見做される唯一の政治形態になった。場合によっては、グローバル官僚機構との繋がりは非常に明確だ。既に指摘したように、新自由主義はあらゆる集団的財産形態を排除することを目指しており、唯一許容される例外は「先住民」に分類される人々である。その結果、世界中で先住民族としての地位を主張する試みが相次ぎ、その中には、以前は自分たちを先住民族と称することなど夢にも思わなかった多くの集団（ケニアの牧畜民マサイ族など）も含まれる。もっと広い視点で見れば、サミュエル・ハンチントンの、イデオロギーの時代が終わった今、残っているのは「文明の戦争」（つまり、宗教と文化のアイデンティティ）だけだという主張は、他のあらゆる歴史の終焉を宣言しようとすることの論理的帰結を完璧に表現している。\n\n代替手段、あるいは「何を目的として上手く機能するのか」\n\nマルクス主義のより粗雑な変種から借用したこの二元論的枠組みがなければ、「共産主義は失敗した」ので、どこにも存在したことのない、純粋な自由市場資本主義という理想を目指す以外に選択肢はないと主張することは不可能だろう。そうでなければ、この議論は、聖公会との長い闘いの後にカトリック教会が崩壊するのを目の当たりにして、したがって私たち全員がバプテスト（あるいはユダヤ教徒）にならなければならないと結論付ける人の議論と同じくらい意味をなさないだろう。歴史をもっと冷静に評価すれば、冷戦に勝つ最も効果的な方法は、限られた社会福祉プログラムと、経済を刺激するための政府の巨額の軍事費の組み合わせであるという結論に至ったように私には思える。また、貧しい国々が豊かな資本主義諸国に経済的に追いつくための最も効果的な方法は、市場の力、主要産業の保護、戦略的な輸出、教育とインフラへの大規模な政府投資を組み合わせたことであると。そして、世界の人口の約10%に可能な限りの物質的生活と最大限の自由を与え、一方で下位3分の1を狼の手に投げ捨てることが目的であるならば、新自由主義こそが間違いなく最善の策であると。また、これらはどれも、「普通の人々が基本的なニーズを満たし、自分にとって最も重要なことを自由に追求できる世界を実現する最も効果的な方法は何か」あるいは「地球が破壊されないようにするにはどうすればいいか」などの他の疑問とは必ずしも関係がないように思える。\n\n資本主義そのもの、少なくとも産業資本主義は、歴史的に見て非常に短い期間しか存在していない。しかし、わずか200年の間に、種の存在そのものに対する脅威を生み出す驚くべき能力を示してきた。最初は核による壊滅、今度は地球規模の気候変動だ。これは長期的には実現可能なシステムではないと信じる十分な理由がある。最も明白なのは、これが継続的な成長の必要性を前提としており、資源が有限な地球では経済成長は永遠に続くことはできないからだ。生産を継続的に拡大する必要性に基づかない資本主義は、単に資本主義ではないだろう。その根本的な力学は変化し、何か別のものに変わるだろう。50年後にどのような経済システムが支配的になるにせよ、それは資本主義以外のものになる可能性が非常に高い。もちろん、その何かはさらに悪いかもしれない。だからこそ、今はまさに資本主義に代わるものを想像すること、つまり、実際に何がより良いのかという考えを出すことを諦めるには間違った時期であるように思える。\n\nだからこそ、私にとって、新自由主義に対する抵抗運動は非常に重要なのだ。これらは、1980年代に世界のほとんどの地域でほとんどすぐに始まり、主に何らかの共有財産を守るための草の根運動を中心に形作られた。[23] 当初、それらはほとんど繋がってなかった。1994年にチアパスで起きたサパティスタの反乱は重要な瞬間だった。実際、サパティスタが最初に国際会議を主催し、それが最終的にメディアが「反グローバリゼーション」運動と呼ぶようになった運動を生み出した。サパティスタが言うように、「人類のために、そして新自由主義に反対する」真に世界的な運動だ。1999年11月のシアトルでのWTO会議、その後のワシントンとプラハ（IMFに対して）、ケベック（米州自由貿易協定[FTAA]に対して）、そしてジェノア（G8に対して）での目を見張る大規模な行動はすべて、何よりもまず、世界経済政策を統制するようになった組織の非民主的な性質を世界に明らかにすることが目的だった。言い換えれば、彼らは、世界のほとんどの人々が明白な結論を導き出すだろうと言う仮定のもとに、この新たなグローバル官僚機構の存在そのものを指摘する役割を果たした。この点で彼らは驚くほど成功した。2年も経たないうちに、1990年代には自明の真理として扱われていた新自由主義の主要教義のほとんどが、あらゆるところで疑問視され始めた。WTOを拡大し、FTAA条約のような新しい貿易協定を締結するという野心的な計画は、完全に頓挫した。\n\n実のところ、テロとの戦いが米国の活動家や国民の注意を逸らし始めて以来、新自由主義の元々の仕組みのほとんどが危機に陥っていることに誰も気づいていないというのは少々皮肉なことだ。2006年にWTOの「ドーハ・ラウンド」は失敗と宣言され、WTOの存在そのものが疑問視されている。IMFは、むしろさらに深刻な危機に陥っている。2002年にアルゼンチン経済が崩壊し、真に政治階級全体に対する民衆の反乱が起こった後、2003年に選出された社会民主党の大統領ネストル・キルチネルは、政府という概念そのものの正当性を回復するために劇的な行動を取らなければならなかった。そこで彼は、アルゼンチンの対外債務のデフォルトを起こした。これはまさにIMFが起こらないようにしなければならなかったはずのことであり、国際銀行家たちはIMFに、アルゼンチンに介入して罰するように促したが、ついにその時はそれができなかった。これにはさまざまな理由があった（部分的には世界的な運動によってIMFが社会の除け者にされていたという事実、部分的にはそもそもその破滅的なアドバイスがアルゼンチンの危機の大きな原因であったことを誰もが知っていたこと）が、結果的に負債による権力構造全体が崩壊し始めた。アルゼンチンとブラジルはIMF債務を全額返済し、その後すぐに、ベネズエラのオイルマネーの助けもあり、ラテンアメリカの他の国々も続いた。（2003年から2007年の間に、ラテンアメリカのIMFに対する総負債額は98.4%減少し、これで彼らの借りは基本的に無くなった。）ロシア、インド、中国もこれに追随し、韓国、タイ、マレーシア、インドネシア、フィリピンなどとともに、現在では新たな融資について話し合うことさえ拒否している。その結果、アフリカを支配する立場に大きく落ち込んだIMF自体、急速に破産に陥りつつある。世界銀行は存続しているが、収入は大幅に減少している。\n\nこうしたことはすべて、米国民の目を逃れて起こっているようだ。一方、世界のほとんどの国では、これまでと異なるより人道的な世界経済がどのようなものになるかについて、活発な議論が続いている。米国では、この運動は改革主義（「反企業主義」）と革命主義（「反資本主義」）のアプローチの間で大きな議論を巻き起こしてきた。世界の多くの国では、こうした議論は国家の潜在的な役割に焦点が当てられるようになった。国家政府の庇護のもとで新しい形のコモンズ（土地、水、石油などの共有資源に対する権利の回復）の創出を望む人々と、国家を完全に拒否し、事実上ある種の自由主義的共産主義を通じて、国境や政府官僚機構のない、直接民主主義を通じて資源を管理する自由なコミュニティの連合体の上に築かれた、いわゆる「真のグローバリゼーション」の世界を夢見る人々を対立させながら。こうした対話から何が生まれるのか、新しい民主主義の形が実際に生まれるのか、それとも世界的な官僚機構の構造の再編が見られるだけなのかを判断するのは時期尚早だ。新自由主義は決して死んではいない。インドや中国など新興国では、国際的な反対勢力を結集することがはるかに難しい中で、同様の改革が大規模に行われている。しかし、私たちはその議論の数々に注意を払うべきだろう。なぜなら、それらは人類の未来の歴史にとって決定的なものとなるかもしれないからだ。\n\n[1]

Generally speaking, I think it’s a good thing that the sun comes up every morning. It does more good than harm . . . . But even if I didn’t much care for the dawn there isn’t much I could do about it.\" (私はグローバリゼーションについて、夜明けについて感じるのと同じように感じる。一般的に言って、私は太陽が毎朝昇るのはいいことだと思う。それは害よりも益をもたらす。しかし、私が夜明けをあまり気にしていなかったとしても、それについて私にできることはあまりない。) Thomas Friedman, The Lexus and the Olive Tree(New York: Anchor Books, 2000), xxi–xxii.\n\n[3] David Harvey, A Brief History of Neoliberalism (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005).\n\n[4] サッチャーはこの点では例外のようなものだったが、彼女でさえ一般投票の3分の1以上を獲得したことはなかった。\n\n[5] より正確に言えば、利息は元本にカウントされない。1980年代半ばまでに、ほとんどの貧しい国々は実際に借りた金額よりも返済した金額の方が遥かに多かった。しかし、金利は全額返済を事実上不可能にするほど高く設定されていた。\n\n[6] 債務救済を政治改革に結びつけるというアイデアは、レーガン政権の国務長官ジェームズ・ベーカーの発案で、ベーカー・プランとして知られるようになった。\n\n[7] マダガスカルの事例は、非暴力革命によって、かつての独裁者ディディエ・ラツィラカに取って代わった政権を握った外科医ザフィがIMFの助言を聞いて豊かになった貧困国の例を一つ挙げろとIMFに要求する不遜さを持っていたため、なおさらよくわかる。彼が署名を拒否した後、経済的荒廃によって、次の選挙で政策の撤回を誓ったラツィラカに敗れた。5年後、ラツィラカは再び民衆の蜂起によって追放されたが、今度は新自由主義的なヨーグルト王によってである。\n\n[8] NAFTAに調印した政府が選挙で正当に選ばれたのではなく、詐欺によって勝利したことを考慮すれば、なおさらである。\n\n[9] Janine WedelのCollision and Collusion: The Strange Case of Western Aid to Eastern Europe, 1989– 1998 (New York: St. Martin’s Press, 1998)を見よ。Wedelは、この驚くべき物語を語った最初の人類学者である。\n\n[10] この大きなシステムと各国政府との関係は新自由主義の時代を通じて大きく変化した。当初は、政府そのものが問題であるとして広く描かれた。その単純な除去は、市場メカニズムの自然発生に繋がると考えられていた。しかし、投資家たちはすぐに、貪欲を公然と奨励し政府という概念そのものを軽んじることで、極端な腐敗が助長され、それがビジネスの邪魔になることに気づいた。東ヨーロッパの多くで「ショック療法」が自由市場ではなく、無法な「ギャング資本主義」をもたらした後ではなおさらだ。クリントン政権下では、「適切な統治」という考え方に重点が移され、特に外国投資に資する誠実な法環境を維持する必要性が強調された。\n\n[11] World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalization, A Fair Globalization: Creating Opportunities for All (Geneva: International Labour Office, 2004); UN Development Program, “Human Development Report,” 1999, and “Human Development Report,” 2003.\n\n[12] 中国が除外されているのにはいくつかの理由がある。最初の期間は、自国主義的な政策によって、ある程度は大きなシステムの外に置かれていた。次の期間では、政府は新自由主義政策の主要な原則を劇的に誇示しつつ、他の発展途上国が放棄を余儀なくされていたような計画、保護、容易な信用取引条件を戦略的に展開していた。\n\n[13] Robert Pollin, Contours of Descent: U.S. Economic Fractures and the Landscape of Global Austerity (London: Verso, 2003).\n\n[14] 統計が曖昧に見えることがあるとすれば、それはこれらの数値の多くが東アジアの大部分で改善したためであり、通常、医療や教育の縮小や民営化を求めるIMFの圧力に抵抗した国々こそ改善したのである。アフリカとラテンアメリカでは抵抗できる国がほとんどなかったため、数値は劇的に低下した。\n\n[15] フィンランドは2004年以来、特別な位置を占め続けている。世界経済フォーラムの2004-5年ランキングでは、フィンランドに次いで米国、スウェーデン、台湾、デンマーク、ノルウェーの順となっている。注目すべきは、上位6カ国には、新自由主義の正統派を支持する国は一つも含まれていないことだ。というのも、アメリカ自身は、他国政府に促している戒律のほとんどを常日頃から反故にしているからだ。レポート全文は、World Economic Forum, “Global Competitiveness Report 2004–2005,” October 2004, www.weforum.org/en/initiatives/gcp/Global% 20Competitiveness%20Report/PastReports/index.htmを参照。\n\n[16] これは、経済学の古臭い知恵の完璧な例と言えるかもしれない。「銀行から100万ドル借りれば、銀行はあなたを所有する。銀行から1億ドル借りれば、あなたが銀行を所有する。」\n\n[17] Walden Bello, Future in the Balance: Essays on Globalization and Resistance (Oakland, CA: Food First Books, 2001).

While \"Conclave\", a film about the \"murky web of curial politics\", is getting Oscar-season buzz, in the real-world Vatican \"a series of events has unfolded behind the Leonine Walls in past months that are just as intriguing\". With only one lung, the fragile 88-year-old Pope Francis sparks alarm with \"every cough or hospital admission\". Around him, the vultures circle – devising strategies to ensure their preferred candidate becomes the next leader of the Catholic Church and its 1.4 billion faithful.\n\nOn one side are Francis's progressives, who want to modernise the Church; on the other, conservative traditionalists who fear \"a shift too far on issues of capitalism, homosexuality, abortion and the role of women\". This week, an unabashed Pope Francis appointed an Italian nun, Sister Raffaella Petrini, to run the Vatican City State – the first time a woman has ever been given the role. Women make better managers than men, said the Pope, adding: \"Women have been running things since the Garden of Eden.\"\n\nIt's all part of Francis's restructuring of Vatican affairs, said Mikael Corre in La Croix (Paris). Under his leadership, some 20 women have been appointed to senior positions in the Holy See, \"from the governing board of the Financial Information Authority to the Secretariat of State, the Vatican Library and the Museums\". The ultimate aim, Francis says, is to incorporate women into every part of ecclesiastical life.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

A Vatican employee, identified only by the initials G.F., claims the Argentinian Pope has \"surrounded himself with Spanish-speaking favourites with progressive agendas\", and that the Vatican is in the grip of two distinct lobbies: a powerful gay clique on the one hand, and the left-wing Santa Marta club on the other. To join the latter, says G.F., \"you have to be green, pro-migrant and above all pro-Palestinian. For them, Nicolás Maduro is a saint and Donald Trump is a devil.\"\n\nFrancis should \"brace\" himself for a battle, said John Kenneth White in The Hill (Washington DC), particularly in the US, where a \"conservative wave\" has flooded the Church. More than half of the country's 3,500 priests described themselves as \"conservative/orthodox\" or \"very conservative/orthodox\" in a recent survey; not one priest ordained after 2020 described himself as \"very progressive\". Meanwhile, President Trump has launched his own \"frontal assault on the papacy\" by appointing Brian Burch – a firebrand anti-Francis \"agitator\" – as his US ambassador to the Vatican.\n\nIt makes for a dramatic final chapter of a pontificate, said Damian Thompson on UnHerd (London). The next conclave \"can't be far off\", but for now Francis remains, combative and compulsively secretive. The Cardinals wait patiently, \"sharpening their knives\".",

        "title": "Judge rules Georgia railroad can seize land as landowners vow to fight",
        "author": "Unknown",
        "published_date": "Unknown",
        "content": "ATLANTA (AP) — A judge has ruled that a Georgia railroad can buy land against the will of property owners to build a track, rebuffing a challenge that a libertarian group hoped could make it harder to use eminent domain to take property.\n\nFulton County Superior Court Judge Craig Schwall Sr. ruled Tuesday that the Sandersville Railroad could condemn a 200-foot (60-meter) wide strip of property running 4.5 miles (7.3 kilometers) to build a rail line serving a rock quarry and other users. Landowners fighting the railroad had appealed a Georgia Public Service Commission ruling allowing the land taking.\n\nSchwall kept a freeze on construction for now, with landowners saying they would appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe case matters because private entities need to condemn private land for railroads and facilities including pipelines and electric transmission lines.\n\nThe Sandersville Railroad, owned by an influential Georgia family, wants to connect the quarry to the CSX railroad at Sparta, allowing products to be shipped widely. Sparta is a mostly Black rural town about 85 miles (135 kilometers) southeast of Atlanta in one of Georgia's poorest counties.\n\nSandersville has agreements to buy some of the 18 parcels it needs. But other owners say losing a strip of property would spoil land they treasure, and that some families have owned for a century.\n\n“Every day that Sandersville isn’t coming onto our land and starting to build is a good day,” Diane Smith, one of the owners, said in a statement. “But we won’t rest easy until we know for sure that they’ll never be able to take our land from us.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrian Brodrick, a lawyer for the railroad, urged opposed property owners in a Thursday statement “to return to the negotiating table so we can bring new opportunities and channels of trade to all the citizens of Hancock County and the region.\" He said the spur would have “minimal impacts” on neighbors.\n\nSome people in the rural neighborhood think the railroad would enable expansion at a quarry owned by Heidelberg Materials, a publicly traded German firm. They dislike the quarry because it generates noise, dust and truck traffic.\n\nSupporters say if the railroad is built, the quarry will move its operation farther from houses, trains will reduce trucks on roads and the railroad will build berms to shield residents.\n\nRailroads have long had the power of eminent domain, but Georgia law says such land seizures must be for “public use.” Opponents targeted the project by saying it would only benefit the quarry. The Sandersville Railroad says there are other users, including a company located at the quarry that blends gravel and asphalt for paving. Several companies have said they would truck products to load them onto the new line, saying they want access to markets served by CSX.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchwall found the railroad met the public use standard, saying it was necessary for the “functioning” of Sandersville and \"also serves a public purpose because it will provide a channel of trade in east middle Georgia.”\n\nThe group representing opponents, the Institute for Justice, hoped to use the case to chip away at eminent domain, the power to legally take private land while paying fair compensation.\n\nThe libertarian-leaning legal group lost a landmark 2005 case allowing the city of New London, Connecticut, to take land from one private owner and transfer it to another private owner for economic development. Schwall cited that case in his ruling.\n\n“We remain committed to proving to the courts that a private railroad’s desire to build a speculative new line entirely for the benefit of a handful of private companies is not a public use under the U.S. and Georgia constitutions and Georgia’s eminent domain laws,” Institute for Justice attorney Bill Maurer said in statement.",

        "author": "Ryan Lattanzio",
        "published_date": "2025-01-31",
        "content": "Zoe Saldaña has responded to the ongoing fallout of “Emilia Pérez” co-star Karla Sofía Gascón’s resurfaced past tweets that have dominated entertainment news since Thursday. Gascón’s past remarks on X — ranging from glib comments about Hitler to disses against George Floyd and diversity at the Academy Awards themselves — have put the trans actress and potential Oscar history-maker’s campaign in jeopardy. Gascón is the first trans performer nominated for an acting Oscar.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter reported the news of the actress’s response first out of a London Q&A on Friday held with Saldaña, who is a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nominee for her role in Jacques Audiard’s Spanish-language musical, a Netflix release.\n\nSaldaña, according to the outlet, was asked about her co-star’s tweets, and said, “I’m still processing everything that has transpired in the last couple of days, and I’m sad. It makes me really sad because I don’t support [it], and I don’t have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group. I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural, and gender equity. And it just saddens me.”\n\nIndieWire confirmed the Q&A took place in London Friday as moderated by Edith Bowman. Watch an excerpt in the video above.\n\nSaldaña continued, “It saddens me that we are having to face this setback right now. But I’m happy that you’re all here and that you’re all still showing up for Emilia because the message that this film has is so powerful and the change that it can bring forward to communities that are marginalized day in and day out is important. And all that I can attest is that all of us that came together to tell this story. We came together for love and for respect and curiosity, and we will continue to spread that message. That’s all we can say right now. Thank you.”\n\nGascón offered a statement of apology Thursday night after major trades and media outlets began reporting on the tweets. “I want to acknowledge the conversation around my past social media posts that have caused hurt. As someone in a marginalized community, I know this suffering all too well and I am deeply sorry to those I have caused pain. All my life I have fought for a better world. I believe light will always triumph over darkness,” Gascón wrote.\n\nIn a translated follow-up statement obtained by THR on Friday, Gascón elaborated, saying, “I’m sorry, but I can no longer allow this campaign of hate and misinformation to affect me and my family, so at their request I am closing my account on X.”\n\nGascón did deactivate her X account as of Friday, and the THR exclusive statement continued, “I have been threatened with death, insulted, abused and harassed to the point of exhaustion. I have a wonderful daughter to protect, whom I love madly and who supports me in everything.”\n\n“Emilia Pérez” is up for 13 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Variety, in the outlet’s Thursday coverage, sought individual translation of the Spanish-language tweets that have put Gascón under fire. Gascón is a Mexican citizen of Spanish origin. She was already under scrutiny after seeming to implicate fellow nominee Fernanda Torres’ publicity in attacking her online in a viral clip shared online Wednesday.\n\n“What I don’t like are social media teams — people who work with these people — trying to diminish our work, like me and my movie, because that doesn’t lead anywhere,” per a Variety translation of an interview published in Brazilian daily Folha de S.Paulo. “You don’t need to tear down someone’s work to highlight another’s. I have never, at any point, said anything bad about Fernanda Torres or her movie. However, there are people working with Fernanda Torres tearing me and ‘Emilia Pérez’ down. That speaks more about their movie than mine.”\n\nIt was thought Gascón’s remarks could have violated Oscar campaigning rules, which state a nominee is not allowed to disparage another nominee. That was debunked, with a statement from Gascón Wednesday night reading, “In my recent comments, I was referencing the toxicity and violent hate speech on social media that I sadly continue to experience. Fernanda has been a wonderful ally, and no one directly associated with her has been anything but supportive and hugely generous.”",

They have been – and will be – ejected from the theatre immediately. We stand against all forms of prejudice and are extremely proud of the inclusivity and respect which Here You Come Again celebrates.”\n\nThe intervention comes after Stevie Webb, one of the stars of Here You Come Again, posted a TikTok video chronicling incidents of abuse the cast had endured on the road.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nWebb revealed that a performance at Manchester’s Opera House last week was temporarily halted after a “woman was so disgusted there was a gay character.” He said the woman was ejected after a “massive ruckus” in which other audience members called out her homophobia. ATG Entertainment, which runs the venue, told BBC News that it took a “zero tolerance” approach to abuse.\n\nWebb added that some of the worst abuse had occurred during performances in London. “I remember one guy who was shouting the F-[word] slur,” he said. “It has really opened my eyes because we’re in such a bubble in this industry. But traveling the country and seeing how many people literally cannot bear to see a gay person depicted on stage – it’s wild.”\n\nHere You Come Again was originally written for U.S. audiences by two-time Emmy-winner Bruce Vilanch with Gabriel Barre (who also directs) and Tricia Paoluccio (who also plays Dolly).

Pearce said he considers himself a victim, but added \"I was certainly not a victim by any means to the extent that other people have been to sexual predators.\"\n\nHe said he tried to ignore advances Spacey made toward him during production, without going into further detail.\n\nPearce said: \"I did that thing where you go: 'Ah, that's nothing. Ah, no, that's nothing.' I did that for five months, and really I was sort of scared of Kevin because he's quite an aggressive man.\n\n\"He's extremely charming and brilliant at what he does, really impressive, etc. He holds a room remarkably. But I was young and susceptible, and he targeted me, no question.\"\n\nHe added: \"I had a couple of confrontations with Kevin post-that, that got ugly.\" Pearce didn't specify what happened, when these alleged interactions were or their outcome.\n\nIn 2017, actor Anthony Rapp accused Spacey of sexually assaulting him at a party in 1986, when he was 14 years old.\n\nRapp sued Spacey in October 2022, but a jury found him not liable after a civil trial in New York.\n\nRapp's allegations were followed by others against Spacey, from men who worked in the film industry and at the Old Vic Theater in London, where Spacey was the artistic director from 2004 to 2015.\n\nRecalling hearing the news, Pearce said: \"I was in London working on something, and I heard this and I broke down and sobbed, and I couldn't stop.\n\n\"I think it really dawned on me the impact that had occurred and how I sort of brushed it off and how I had either shelved it or blocked it out or whatever. That was a really incredible wake-up call I suppose.\"\n\nIn 2024, Spacey responded to a documentary about the allegations: \"I take full responsibility for my past behaviour and my actions. But I cannot and will not take responsibility or apologise to anyone who's made up stuff about me or exaggerated stories about me.\"\n\nKevin Spacey told Guy Pearce to \"grow up\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Spacey responded to Pearce's comments in a video posted on X.\n\nHe said: \"We worked together a long time ago, if I did something then that upset you, you could've reached out to me, we could've had that conversation. But instead, you decided to speak to the press, who of course are now coming after me because they'd like to know what my response is to the things that you said.

You are not a victim. pic.twitter.com/33paGTj4Aq — Kevin Spacey (@KevinSpacey) February 18, 2025\n\nDuring the video, Spacey also claimed that Pearce visited him on the set of \"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\" in Savannah, Georgia in 1997 to spend time with him.\n\nRepresentatives for Pearce and Spacey did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.",

        "published_date": "Unknown",
        "content": "Andrew emails show contact with Epstein lasted beyond 2010\n\nPrince Andrew has faced ongoing questions about his links to Jeffrey Epstein\n\nIn his BBC Newsnight interview, Prince Andrew had said he had not seen or spoken to Epstein after going to his house in New York in December 2010, a meeting which he described as a \"wrong decision\".\n\nThe court documents, from the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), show the email as being sent in February 2011.\n\n\"Keep in close touch and we'll play some more soon!!!!\" said an email sent to Epstein from a \"member of the British Royal Family\", believed to be Prince Andrew.\n\nThe Duke of York was in contact with the US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein longer than he had previously admitted, emails published in court documents appear to show.\n\nThe email was revealed in a court case involving the FCA and banker Jes Staley, who was banned from senior positions in the financial services industry over claims he had not fully revealed the extent of his relationship with Epstein.\n\nStaley had been CEO at Barclays, but left the bank following an investigation into his connection to Epstein, which he has said he deeply regretted.\n\nStaley is appealing against the FCA's ruling, but the financial regulator's evidence showing Staley's contact with Epstein also reveals emails relating to a \"member of the British Royal Family\".\n\nThese email exchanges between the royal and Epstein appear friendly and familiar.\n\nIn June 2010, Epstein emailed: \"If you can find time to show jes around with vera that would be fun.. he told me he ran into you tonight,\" in messages first reported by business news agency Bloomberg.\n\nThe Royal Family member responded by asking who Vera was, and a few days later Epstein replied: \"my future ex wife, i know jes and she would love to see home\". A dinner then seems to have been arranged.\n\nIn Prince Andrew's Newsnight interview, he was asked about the extent of his association with wealthy financier Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting a further trial.\n\nThe prince said that he had ceased contact with Epstein \"after I was aware that he was under investigation and that was later in 2006 and I wasn't in touch with him again until 2010\".\n\nA photographer had captured Prince Andrew and Epstein walking together in New York's Central Park in December 2010, while the prince stayed at Epstein's house.\n\n\"Was that visit, December of 2010, the only time you saw him after he was convicted?\" interviewer Emily Maitlis had asked the royal.\n\nPrince Andrew replied \"yes\". Maitlis then asked: \"Did you see him or speak to him again?\", to which Andrew responded: \"No.\"\n\nBut emails a few months after that New York meeting suggest, if not a direct conversation, there were still friendly exchanges.\n\nAccording to the court documents, on 27 February 2011, Epstein emailed: \"jes staley will be in London on next tue afternoon, if you have time.\"\n\nThere was a reply from the \"member of the British Royal Family\" with a question: \"Jes is coming on 1st March or next week?\"\n\nThe court documents say there was a \"discussion of press articles\" and then the message: \"Keep in close touch and we'll play some more soon!!!!\"\n\nPrince Andrew is believed to have first met Epstein in 1999, through Epstein's friend Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nThe following year, in June 2000, Epstein and Maxwell were among guests at a party at Windsor Castle. Later that year, Prince Andrew held a birthday party for Maxwell at Sandringham, with Epstein in attendance.\n\nThe relationship appeared to continue, with Epstein attending another Windsor Castle party in July 2006 - after which Prince Andrew said he stopped contact with Epstein until their December 2010 meeting.\n\nBetween those times, in 2008, Epstein was convicted in the US for procuring a minor for prostitution and was sentenced to 18 months in prison.\n\nAfter Epstein left prison, Prince Andrew met him in New York in 2010. Andrew said this meeting was to end their relationship.\n\nIn July 2019, Epstein was arrested on charges of the sex trafficking of minors. He died in prison in August 2019 while awaiting trial.\n\nIn November that year, Prince Andrew gave his Newsnight interview and in the subsequent fallout stepped down from royal duties.\n\nThe Duke of York's office has been contacted for comment.",

        "author": "Unknown",
        "published_date": "Unknown",
        "content": "What we've learned about Rachel Reeves's expenses - and the Labour response\n\n14 February 2025 Billy Kenber Politics investigations correspondent Sean Seddon BBC News\n\nReuters\n\nSince BBC News reported on Thursday that Rachel Reeves had exaggerated her online CV and had been investigated over her use of expenses while working at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS), Labour colleagues have mounted a robust defence of the chancellor. Sir Keir Starmer said she had \"dealt with any issues that arise\" from the questions about her CV, and Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Newsnight that she was doing a \"brilliant and difficult job\". But Labour figures have questioned our reporting on the expenses investigation, with one cabinet minister calling it totally inaccurate. Here we examine the key Labour responses and look at the evidence that supports our journalism.\n\nWhat did we reveal about Reeves's expenses?\n\nThe BBC News investigation revealed that concerns were raised about Reeves's expenses while working at HBOS between 2006 and 2009. A detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint was submitted, with dozens of pages of supporting documents including emails, receipts and memos. It accused Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was her boss, of using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\", with spending on events, taxis and gifts, including for each other. We have seen these documents and spoken to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues. The chancellor and her expenses before she became an MP\n\nWhat happened to the whistleblower's complaint?\n\nThe complaint led to an internal investigation by the bank's risk department. This was passed to internal audit, which reviewed the allegations and concluded that they were substantiated and there appeared to be evidence of wrongdoing by Reeves and her two colleagues, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation. What we have not been able to establish is what happened next and whether the bank ever reached a formal conclusion.\n\nHow are Labour defending Reeves?\n\nReeves has said she was not aware of an investigation or issue with her expenses and said she left the bank on good terms. She said her expenses had always been signed off in the proper way. The person who signed off her expenses, her boss, was also subject to the internal investigation. Other Labour figures have criticised BBC News's reporting on the story, with two MPs repeating similar attacks. On Friday, Science Secretary Peter Kyle told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the reporting was \"inaccurate\". Both he and Siobhain McDonagh, a Labour MP who appeared on BBC's Politics Live on Thursday, raised comments by a former HR manager, Jane Wayper - which, they said, disproved the BBC News's story.\n\nEPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock Science Secretary Peter Kyle has criticised the BBC's reporting on Rachel Reeves\n\nWhat did the HR manager say?\n\nWayper spoke to the BBC after being given permission to do so by Reeves's team. She provided an on-the-record statement which said she \"would have been made aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" on the basis that she \"would have been required to organise and oversee a disciplinary process\". However, the BBC has not reported that the case reached a formal conclusion, or that there was disciplinary action. Kyle incorrectly claimed that the quote had not been included in our report - but it had been in the article since it was first published on Thursday morning. He also incorrectly referred to Wayper as the head of HR at the bank. In reality she was an HR business partner working in the department where Reeves worked.\n\nWhat has Reeves said?\n\nOn Friday, Reeves was asked about the expenses claims directly. She said: \"No-one ever raised any concerns about my expenses when I worked for Halifax Bank of Scotland.\" She said her expenses had been \"signed off in the proper way\" and \"no issues were ever raised\" during her time at the bank. Her expenses were signed off by her manager, who was also one of the three employees who were the subject of the expenses probe. Reeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank. There is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor left the bank on good terms.\n\nWhat has BBC News established about her LinkedIn CV?",

        "title": "London’s first Roman basilica found under office basement",
        "author": "Unknown",
        "published_date": "Unknown",
        "content": "Beginnings of Roman London discovered in office basement\n\n12 February 2025 Rebecca Morelle • @BBCMorelle Science Editor Alison Francis Senior Science Journalist\n\nTony Jolliffe/ BBC The wall is 2,000 years old and was part of Roman London's first basilica\n\nA discovery underneath the basement of an office block has been described as one of the most important pieces of Roman history unearthed in the city of London. Archaeologists have found a substantial piece of the ancient city's first basilica - a 2,000 year old public building where major political, economic and administrative decisions were made. The excavation has so far revealed sections of stone wall that formed the base of the basilica, which would have been two-and-a-half storeys high. The site, which will eventually be opened to the public, sheds light on the city's beginnings.\n\nTony Jolliffe/BBC Archaeologists found the Roman masonry under the concrete floor of the office\n\n\"This is so significant - this is the heart of Roman London,\" said Sophie Jackson, from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola), who revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News. \"This building will tell us so much about the origins of London, why London grew and why it was chosen as the capital of Britain. It's just amazing.\"\n\nTony Jolliffe/ BBC News The wall is made of limestone from Kent\n\nThe site was discovered at 85 Gracechurch Street, an office building that's about to be demolished and redeveloped. Earlier archaeological investigations revealed the ancient basilica's approximate location, so the team created several small test pits to see what was hidden beneath the concrete floor. On the third attempt, digging between the filing cabinets, they struck lucky. \"You can see a huge chunk of Roman masonry, and it's incredible that it survives this well. We're absolutely thrilled that there's so much of it here,\" said Sophie Jackson.\n\nTony Jolliffe/BBC A tile is stamped and the three lines next to it are the finger marks of the tile maker\n\nThe wall is made from a type of limestone from Kent, and formed an imposing building - the basilica would have been about 40m long, 20m wide and 12m high. Other artefacts have been found too, including a roof tile imprinted with the stamp of an official from the ancient city.\n\nThe basilica was part of London's forum, a social and commercial hub with a courtyard that was about the size of a football pitch. \"The basilica is the town hall, and then in front of it was a big open market square with a range of shops and offices around the outside,\" explained Ms Jackson. \"It's the place you came to do business, to get your court case sorted out, it's where laws were made, and it's where decisions were made about London, but also about the rest of the country.\" It was built around 80 AD, just a few decades after the Romans invaded Britain and founded Londinium - the Roman name for the city. But the first basilica and forum were only in use for about 20 years. They were replaced by a much larger second forum, perhaps reflecting how quickly the city was growing in size and importance.\n\nPeter Marsden The basilica sits at the back of the Roman forum, which had an open courtyard\n\nThe discovery has meant a change of plans for the building's owners, Hertshten Properties. The Roman remains, which will now be fully excavated, are to be incorporated into the new offices - pending planning approval - and opened up to the public. For the architects, redesigning a building around an archaeological site has had some technical challenges. \"The scheme has been comprehensively adjusted,\" explained James Taylor from architecture firm Woods Bagot. \"Simple things like the columns have had to literally move position, so you're not destroying all these special stones that we found in the ground.\" And so as not to disturb what's there, fewer lifts can now be installed - and this has meant that the team has had to reduce the height of the building. But Mr Taylor said the effort will be worth it. \"To actually see people using and enjoying the space, moving through the public hall and down to see the remains, will be absolutely incredible.\"\n\nWoods Bagot An artist's impression of what the public will eventually be able to see",

In a statement to Windows Central, a Microsoft spokesperson said \"To better align with its focus on digital growth, Microsoft has decided to exit the lease at the Microsoft Experience Centre in London early.\"\n\nThe 21,000 square foot Microsoft Store in London first opened in July 2019 to much fanfare. It was designed to be a hub for technology from both Microsoft and its partners, showcasing high-end hardware from third-party OEMs as well as the latest products from Surface and Xbox.\n\nThe store also included an Answer Desk and support area, where Surface and Xbox customers could bring their devices for technical support should they need it. With the only physical storefront now closing, this will no longer be an avenue for support for customers with Surface PCs or Xbox consoles.\n\nUnfortunately, even though the Microsoft Store is located in a prime location in the heart of London's Oxford Street, the store seemingly hasn’t seen much footfall since its original launch date. \"We regularly review our locations and our workforce to ensure we are aligning to market opportunities and make changes to meet the demands of the business\" said the Microsoft spokesperson.\n\nIn addition to being a storefront and experience centre, Microsoft also used the space for business meetings with partners and colleagues. The store featured three floors, with the first two being used as retail space, and the third floor consisting of meeting spaces that the company frequently used.\n\nThe closure of the Microsoft Store in the UK is another blow for Microsoft's consumer facing products and services, which will no longer have a home on the streets of London. The company has been significantly scaling back on Surface and consumer efforts in the last handful of years, and the UK Microsoft Store is the latest victim.",

The closure of a loophole allowing importers to avoid taxes on shipments valued less than $800 when sent directly to consumers has left brands like Shein and Temu scrambling .\n\nConcerns about logistics continued yesterday when the US Postal Service said that it is suspending inbound parcels from China and Hong Kong until further notice , effective immediately. While only parcels are impacted, the suspension may cause exporters to use alternative logistics companies like DHL, UPS, and FedEx.

        "content": "The Pentagon is developing AI-enabled satellite technology.\n\nAI satellites offer advantages amid intensifying competition in space.\n\nThey could supercharge data analysis and help evade the consequences of a Chinese cyber-attack.\n\nA vast network of military satellites belonging to the US has long underpinned its dominance in space. But China is challenging the US status as the space superpower, and its satellite system is in the crosshairs.\n\nDefense News reported last month that the US Navy is moving forward with plans to build a network of fully autonomous satellites that are able to navigate independently without GPS or ground control.\n\nAnalysts say that AI could help the US stay ahead, providing its satellites with the capacity to evade the consequences of a potentially crippling attack, as well as more power to collect and analyze large amounts of data.\n\nThe race for satellite dominance\n\nThe stakes in the battle for satellite supremacy are high, Melanie Garson, an associate professor in International Conflict Resolution & International Security at University College London, told Business Insider.\n\nThe winner would control a vital aspect of space infrastructure, which would also provide an advantage in intelligence gathering and precision strikes in the event of a war.\n\nAI \"will provide additional capabilities for surveillance and espionage as well as being able to interfere with the other's space assets through spectrum warfare or cyberattacks,\" Garson said.\n\nThe US has hundreds of military satellites in orbit, with China and Russia not far behind.\n\nIf a war were to break out between the US and China, military experts say that China has the capability to do serious damage to US space-based assets through a range of anti-satellite, or ASAT, capabilities, including programming its satellites to attack others.\n\nA CIA report that leaked in 2023 said China was focusing its efforts in the event of a war on hacking the systems used to control US satellite networks.\n\nSystems confrontation and destruction warfare is believed to be a preferred Chinese military tactic for 21st-century warfare.\n\nCrippling these systems would leave satellites unable to transfer communications and data, or even coordinate with each other, the report said.\n\nRelated stories\n\nAI could be the key\n\nAI for satellites could be crucial to preserving US capabilities. Unlike satellites that require human input, autonomous satellites can operate independently, processing and analyzing data to make their own decisions.\n\nThe autonomy makes them less vulnerable to possible attacks on bases or communications networks or to being cut off from operators by electronic warfare like signal jamming, said Clayton Swope, deputy director of the Aerospace Security Project and a senior fellow in the Defense and Security Department at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\"Decentralized decision-making may add resilience by decreasing the reliance on ground-based infrastructure,\" Krista Langeland, deputy lead of the RAND Space Enterprise Initiative, told BI. \"AI capabilities could also help with detection and characterization of an attack.\"\n\nAnother advantage is that AI could help process vast amounts of data in space, and identify potentially hostile satellites more quickly.\n\n\"Space is huge,\" Swope said, \"so AI will help satellites better understand what's happening around them and keep track of what other satellites are doing.\"\n\n\"That could help US satellites maneuver to avoid accidental collisions but also stay clear of potentially hostile adversarial satellites,\" he said.\n\nA distant goal\n\nThe power of the technology to revolutionize US satellite technology and security is significant, Alison Grey, a satellites expert at PA Consulting, told BI.\n\n\"Ultimately, AI-enabled automation can enable a network to react and recover from various threats in space,\" she said, \"whether that's from natural phenomena, anomalies in one's own system, or potentially hostile activity.\"\n\nHowever, while the technology is already being applied in some military satellites, realizing its full potential is likely to be some way off.\n\nSpace Force's former top acquisition official, Frank Calvelli, told an event last year that he expects satellites to be \"significantly more autonomous\" within the next 10 to 15 years.\n\nEven so, efforts are intensifying to begin realizing its potential. Defense News said that the US Navy is researching a fully autonomous model, the Autosat, and wants to take the tests further.\n\n\"We've done a demo of this and proven out the principles and are looking for the next step,\" Steven Meier, director of space technology at the Naval Research Laboratory, said at a recent summit in Virginia. \"We want to get funding to actually build a system along these lines and launch it.\"",

The man, named only as David, told French broadcaster BFM TV he was on a call with his sister at Nantes station on Sunday when an employee from SNCF, the French railway company, approached him. David said he was told that he would be fined €150 if he did not turn off the loudspeaker - a fine which he claims was later increased to €200 because he did not pay it on the spot. He has since hired a lawyer to dispute the fine. SNCF confirmed the man was fined by its security staff in a quiet area of the station.\n\nThe state-owned train company disputed some details of the passenger's account, according to French outlet La Parisien. David, reported to be 54 years old, said he initially hung up the phone when he was told about the fine, thinking it was a joke, BFM TV reported. SNCF described an escalating interaction between the passenger and its staff member before the fine was issued. It told BBC News its security staff operate on trains and at stations and are authorised to issue fines against passengers. SNCF confirmed the fine increased from €150 \"because the customer refused to pay\". According to Ouest-France, the incident happened on Sunday. While there is no national law in France prohibiting the use of mobile phones on loudspeaker in public places, there are noise control regulations. According to the French Transport Code, those who use \"sound devices or instruments\" or \"disturb the peace of others by noise\" in areas used for public transport could face a fine.\n\nStrong feelings",

She was cheered and clapped out by colleagues, who gathered in the studio.\n\n“It’s been an honor and a privilege to work with some of the best and hardest working teams in the business news,” she said. “After over a million minutes of live TV news, more than anyone else in the world, it’s time for me to indulge in some of my other passions, including my love for travel.”\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nIn an email to staff, David Rhodes, Sky News executive chairman, said: “Kay’s legacy in television journalism is unmatched, as is her commitment to Sky’s legacy.

She apologized for the “error of judgment.”\n\nRhodes, the former CBS News president, has been evolving the channel’s schedule amid changes in viewing habits and increased competition from GB News. Sky News has set a target of being a “premium video-first newsroom built for the digital future” by 2030.\n\nThere has been speculation at Sky News for months about who will replace Burley on breakfast.

Steve Oemcke, the other co-founder, remains Chief Creative Officer and Derek Dyson is Chief Commercial Officer.\n\nWTFN is best known for Australian unscripted shows such as Bondi Vet, Sydney Harbour Force, The Hunters, Emergency and Space Invaders, but also operates in international distribution through subsidiary Fred Media and digital vendor Radar. The two sales businesses merged in September last year.\n\nTalbot, a former Nine Network producer and news reporter, launched WTFN with former gameshow host Oemcke in 2003, and they have gone on to build one of Australia‘s most prolific independent production and distribution operations. The Sydney-based company owns a library of more than 2,000 in-house hours, a sizeable number including numerous multi-season returners, and talent agency Empire Talent, and has offices in L.A. and London.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThis shuffle is among the most significant management switches at the company to date. “We have been through some restructuring,” Talbot told Deadline. “The industry isn’t standing still and you can’t be left behind. The new structure gives me headspace to think about our strategy and our international focus.”\n\nSteve Oemcke and Daryl Talbot WTFN\n\nTalbot said that while there is “no denying from a macro-economic position that the last few years have been pretty tough for everyone,” WTFN starts 2025 in “probably the strongest position we’ve ever been in.” He predicted the company will experience double-digit digital growth this year, and added, “It has been a journey to get here and navigate the changes in the industry, along with Covid. To come out of all of that and be really well placed is great.”\n\nLast year, we revealed WTFN had engaged a bank to explore a sale or new investment with distribution growth in mind, but nothing has materialized yet on that front and it remains privately owned.\n\nTalbot declined to comment when asked about the process this, but was keen to talk up how the company had built up value through what WTFN calls a ‘total distribution’ strategy after realizing that production alone wouldn’t keep the business alive. This comprised identifying the need for an international sales business more than a decade ago, and launching a digital business that includes FAST channels and social media content.\n\n“We went from building houses to building houses, owning them and renting them out,” said Talbot. “That has allowed us to build out own library and given us options going forward. We’ve got a strong recurring production business that consistently does a job for the networks, and we’re out there pitching new shows, but owning and controlling the content is critical to the future. You have to have the commercial model that allows you to think up those new shows.”",

        "title": "Rachel Reeves: What we've learned about her expenses and Labour response",
        "author": "Unknown",
        "published_date": "Unknown",
        "content": "What we've learned about Rachel Reeves's expenses - and the Labour response\n\n14 February 2025 Billy Kenber Politics investigations correspondent Sean Seddon BBC News\n\nReuters\n\nSince BBC News reported on Thursday that Rachel Reeves had exaggerated her online CV and had been investigated over her use of expenses while working at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS), Labour colleagues have mounted a robust defence of the chancellor. Sir Keir Starmer said she had \"dealt with any issues that arise\" from the questions about her CV, and Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Newsnight that she was doing a \"brilliant and difficult job\". But Labour figures have questioned our reporting on the expenses investigation, with one cabinet minister calling it totally inaccurate. Here we examine the key Labour responses and look at the evidence that supports our journalism.\n\nWhat did we reveal about Reeves's expenses?\n\nThe BBC News investigation revealed that concerns were raised about Reeves's expenses while working at HBOS between 2006 and 2009. A detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint was submitted, with dozens of pages of supporting documents including emails, receipts and memos. It accused Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was her boss, of using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\", with spending on events, taxis and gifts, including for each other. We have seen these documents and spoken to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues. The chancellor and her expenses before she became an MP\n\nWhat happened to the whistleblower's complaint?\n\nThe complaint led to an internal investigation by the bank's risk department. This was passed to internal audit, which reviewed the allegations and concluded that they were substantiated and there appeared to be evidence of wrongdoing by Reeves and her two colleagues, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation. What we have not been able to establish is what happened next and whether the bank ever reached a formal conclusion.\n\nHow are Labour defending Reeves?\n\nReeves has said she was not aware of an investigation or issue with her expenses and said she left the bank on good terms. She said her expenses had always been signed off in the proper way. The person who signed off her expenses, her boss, was also subject to the internal investigation. Other Labour figures have criticised BBC News's reporting on the story, with two MPs repeating similar attacks. On Friday, Science Secretary Peter Kyle told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the reporting was \"inaccurate\". Both he and Siobhain McDonagh, a Labour MP who appeared on BBC's Politics Live on Thursday, raised comments by a former HR manager, Jane Wayper - which, they said, disproved the BBC News's story.\n\nEPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock Science Secretary Peter Kyle has criticised the BBC's reporting on Rachel Reeves\n\nWhat did the HR manager say?\n\nWayper spoke to the BBC after being given permission to do so by Reeves's team. She provided an on-the-record statement which said she \"would have been made aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" on the basis that she \"would have been required to organise and oversee a disciplinary process\". However, the BBC has not reported that the case reached a formal conclusion, or that there was disciplinary action. Kyle incorrectly claimed that the quote had not been included in our report - but it had been in the article since it was first published on Thursday morning. He also incorrectly referred to Wayper as the head of HR at the bank. In reality she was an HR business partner working in the department where Reeves worked.\n\nWhat has Reeves said?\n\nOn Friday, Reeves was asked about the expenses claims directly. She said: \"No-one ever raised any concerns about my expenses when I worked for Halifax Bank of Scotland.\" She said her expenses had been \"signed off in the proper way\" and \"no issues were ever raised\" during her time at the bank. Her expenses were signed off by her manager, who was also one of the three employees who were the subject of the expenses probe. Reeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank. There is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor left the bank on good terms.\n\nWhat has BBC News established about her LinkedIn CV?",

Tartus, on the Mediterranean, is unique in Russia's assets in being its only warm-water port with direct access to the oceans.\n\nThe rebel groups now governing Syria were previously targetted by Russian forces, but Abu Qasra told the Post, \"in politics, there are no permanent enemies.\"\n\nOne trump card held by Russia is Assad himself. According to the Post, the new Syrian government wants Assad's extradition so that he can be held to account for his bloody rule.",

I’m grateful to work alongside some of the finest journalists anywhere.”\n\nSpiegel most recently serves as FT’s U.S. managing editor, overseeing editorial operations in the Americas over the past nearly six years, including its expansion strategy and coverage as well as daily news operations for print and online.\n\nDuring his tenure, the publication won six Gerald Loeb Awards and 13 British Press Awards, including News Website of the Year in 2017 and Newspaper of the Year in 2018. He also served as the head of FT’s London newsroom and its Brussels bureau chief and a Washington business correspondent, leading coverage on the Justice Department, the Federal Communications Commission and other federal regulatory agencies, with a special focus on corporate crime, including its coverage of the Enron scandal.\n\nAdditionally, he held various reporting positions at The Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal from 2006 to 2010, covering foreign policy and military affairs with a special focus on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, frequently traveling overseas and visiting the war zones. Spiegel began his career as a reporter for Roll Call and Forbes Magazine.\n\n“Peter brings brilliant experience, digital expertise, management chops and a great nose for big stories and areas of opportunity,” Murray added. “He will be central as we shape the next great chapter for The Washington Post.”\n\nSpiegel’s appointment comes as the Post has seen several staffers depart after its billionaire owner Jeff Bezos nixed the editorial board’s plan to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for president before the 2024 election — marking the first time in 36 years the paper didn’t endorse a presidential candidate.\n\nThose who have exited include democracy editor Griff Witte, columnists Jen Rubin and Michele Norris, cartoonist Ann Telnaes, editor Philip Rucker, investigative reporter Josh Dawsey, political correspondents Ashley Parker and Michael Scherer and White House reporter Tyler Pager.\n\nAdditionally, WaPo laid off roughly 100 employees earlier this month.",

        "content": "Preparations are well underway for the 75th edition of the Berlinale\n\nBy Femke COLBORNE and Adam PLOWRIGHT\n\nThe Berlin Film Festival, which begins this week, is set for a challenge faced by the entire Western arts industry: how to stop politics from taking over the conversation.\n\nThe first major European film festival of the year saw its 2024 edition overshadowed by a row about Israel's bombardment of Gaza that left a mark on many filmmakers.\n\nThis year, Germany's national election -- which polls suggest could see unprecedented gains for the far-right AfD party -- falls on the final Sunday of the festival on February 23.\n\nThe festival's new director Tricia Tuttle said the Berlinale would not \"shy away\" from current events, but she hoped they would not entirely eclipse the on-screen stories.\n\n\"For all festivals and all culture right now, the news agenda can often dominate the discourse,\" she added as she presented this year's lineup on January 21.\n\n\"But we really hope that the films that audiences are going to see over the next weeks of the festival are going to get people talking about the vibrancy of the art form itself and the films themselves.\"\n\nThat may be the stated aim, but the opening night on Thursday will pitch the festival firmly into political territory with a film that touches on one of Germany's most sensitive issues -- immigration.\n\n\"Das Licht\" (\"The Light\") by German director Tom Tykwer features a middle-class German family whose lives are transformed by their mysterious Syrian housekeeper.\n\nThe mass arrival of Syrian refugees and other migrants in Germany in 2015-16 has helped fuel support for the AfD, which is forecast to emerge as one of the biggest parties nationally according to polls.\n\nLast year, organizers made headlines by barring five previously invited AfD politicians and telling them they were \"not welcome\".\n\n\"It would be nice if the main talking points were the films that are going to be shown, but I don't think that's the world we live in right now,\" Scott Roxborough, The Hollywood Reporter's European bureau chief, told AFP.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and his radical rightwing agenda are on everyone's minds, he said, as well as AfD-backing Elon Musk and the rise of artificial intelligence.\n\n\"There is definitely a general angst around AI in particular in the film industry,\" Roxborough added.\n\nThe selection of films set for Berlin stays true to the festival's mission of showcasing independent arthouse filmmakers from around the world, with a sprinkling of A-listers.\n\nHollywood director Richard Linklater's latest movie starring Ethan Hawke \"Blue Moon\" is in official competition, 11 years after Linklater won Berlin's Silver Bear for Best Director for \"Boyhood\".\n\nSouth Korean director Bong Joon-ho will present his new film \"Mickey 17\" with Robert Pattinson out of competition, while British actor Tilda Swinton will receive a lifetime achievement award.\n\nJessica Chastain, Marion Cotillard and Timothee Chalamet will add some stardust, while the jury is helmed by American director Todd Haynes.\n\nTuttle took up her job running the Berlinale in April last year, arriving with a reputation burnished by her time as head of the growing London Film Festival.\n\nThe American admitted that her first year had been \"challenging\" following controversy linked to criticism of Israel over its war in Gaza at the awards ceremony in 2024.\n\nUS filmmaker Ben Russell, wearing a Palestinian scarf, accused Israel of committing \"genocide\", while Palestinian filmmaker Basel Adra said the Gaza population was being \"massacred\".\n\nA spokeswoman for the German government, a staunch ally of Israel, and Berlin's mayor condemned the remarks afterwards as \"unacceptable\".\n\nTuttle admitted that the criticism had led some filmmakers to worry about whether they could exercise their right to freedom of expression.\n\nOne independent film producer told AFP on condition of anonymity that some directors had decided not to return until they had seen how Tuttle manages the issue.\n\nThe 2025 festival is set to screen a new documentary about an Israeli actor taken hostage by Hamas, as well as Claude Lanzmann's monumental 1985 epic on the Holocaust, \"Shoah\", which is more than nine hours long.\n\n\"Berlin has always been a place of big political discussion,\" Roxborough said.\n\n© 2025 AFP",

Musk also said payments must provide a rationale in a comment field, adding they are ‘not yet applying ANY judgment to this rationale’ but that all payments must have one.\n\n“Yet” is doing a lot of work, there, no? Essentially, Elon wants the memo field on government checks filled out. There is no reason for this, either for the code or the rationale, if you believe (modulo cases of fraud) that all that is required to issue a check is Congressional appropriation (i.e., a statute) or agency approval, as has hitherto been the case. The obvious reason for this architectural change to Treasury’s outputs is to bolt or kludge a second processor onto the existing back-end of the payments system, which would serve as a filter. This second processor would take existing outputs as input, but the “reporting changes” would enable the Executive to filter for checks based on the category or the rationale (or, for that matter, on the SSN; why not?), and then impound (not output) them. A less obvious reason is for future integration into “the blockchain,” perhaps “a bad idea whose time has come.” An even less obvious reason is to alter the checks: If you want to reduce Federal Spending by 20%, have the filter reduce the amount of every check by 20%.

        "content": "The Irish ambassador in London personally approved a book launch for ex-housing minister Eoghan Murphy, saying it would help demonstrate “the challenges faced by political officeholders” in the modern world.\n\nThe state-funded event, which was described as “grotesque” by one opposition TD, was hailed by Eoghan Murphy’s team as a “superbly well-­organised and joyful event”.\n\nAn email said the former Fine Gael minister was a “very happy author” with gratitude extended to “the whole gang, from Guinness pourers, black pudding canape deliverers to front of staff welcomers”.\n\nAn event approval form said the estimated cost would be GB£2,614 and it would help illustrate the “challenges faced by politicians in tackling their remit”.\n\nIt was organised after publishers Eriu directly contacted the Irish ambassador Martin Fraser in August letting them know about the imminent publication of Running from Office, which was described as a “remarkably well-written and compelling book that deserves to be read by everyone interested in politics”.\n\nMr Fraser responded in early September, saying the embassy would be “very happy” to work with the publisher on the UK launch.\n\nHe wrote: “As well as the obvious Irish dimension, we would hope the event could enable us to reach a wider audience in London with an interest in politics, and in particular the very topical issue of the challenges faced by political officeholders at this time.”\n\nEoghan Murphy. Photo: PA\n\nToday's News in 90 seconds - 2nd February 2025\n\n​Mr Fraser became Irish ambassador in 2022, after having spent more than a decade as secretary general at the Department of the Taoiseach.\n\nAn official form said the event would be held in the ballroom in Grosvenor Place, London, with around 120 guests expected.\n\nIn discussions with the publisher, the Irish Embassy said it would favour a reading and an “in-conversation” piece, followed by a reception.\n\nBy mid-November, broadcaster Ryan Tubridy had been confirmed as host and publishers told embassy staff the book was Ireland’s number one non-fiction title. An email from the embassy said: “That’s great news, on both counts! And should make for a great event here, too!”\n\nThe event caused controversy in Ireland, with People before Profit TD Ruth Coppinger saying it was “grotesque” and showed there was an inside track in public life.\n\nAt the time, the department said the event had cost just over GB£2,000. However, in response to a query under Freedom of Information, it said the final bill had come to £2,614, the equivalent of just over €3,000.\n\nAn information note said: “The total final bill… has been calculated based on more up-to-date unit costs which reflect inflation in 2024.\n\n“As the embassy hosts many events per year and supplies are purchased in bulk, these costs are based on the average consumption per event.”",

        "author": "Unknown",
        "published_date": "Unknown",

(2009)\n\nアメリカ人はしばしば世界の他の地域の人々と政治の話をすることに困難を覚える。2005年12月末に世界中のニュースワイヤーから多かれ少なかれ無作為に抜粋した3つの引用を見てみよう。ボリビアでは、新たに大統領に選出されたエボ・モラレスが「国民は新自由主義者を打ち負かした」と宣言し、「私たちは新自由主義モデルを変えたい」と付け加えた。ドイツでは、ロタール・ビスキーが、新政党の結成が「新自由主義が社会的結束に与えるダメージに対抗する民主的な代替案を生み出すことに貢献する」こと期待すると発表した。同じ頃、あるパン・アフリカ主義のウェブジャーナルが、「モーリシャス、スワジランド、マリといった遠く離れた国々からの新自由主義に代わる経済についての議論の高まりを反映した」特集号を発表した。[1]\n\nこれらはたった3つだが、容易に何十も見つけることができるだろう。地球上のほとんどの地域で、新自由主義はよく知られた言葉だ。新自由主義についての議論は、日常的な政治的会話の材料となっている。政治家は、新自由主義者であるとか、新自由主義的なアジェンダを追求していると非難され、野党候補は新自由主義に反対することで当選する（が、その後多くの場合、新自由主義に屈したとして元支持者から非難される）。新自由主義は世界の支配的なイデオロギー勢力と見做されている。世界に唯一残された超大国である米国が自国の社会・経済モデルを世界に拡大する試みだというのである。それは避けられないことであり、望ましいとさえ言う者もいれば、それに抗う運動もある。しかし、ほとんどの人がこれに対して意見を持っているのだ。\n\nアメリカではこの言葉を聞くことは少ない。学者や国際問題担当者を除くほとんどの人に対して、この言葉を口にしても虚な視線を向けられるだろう。実のところ、同じ問題について話そうとすれば、自由貿易、自由市場改革、グローバリゼーションといった明らかなプロパガンダ用語に頼らざるを得ない。最初の２つにおけるバイアスは明らかだ。中立であろうとするならば、頭に自由という言葉は付けないものである。グローバリゼーションはもう少しだけ微妙だ。何かを「新自由主義」と呼ぶときに言っているのは、それが経済を構築する最良の方法に関する数ある理論のうちの一つの思想体系にすぎないということである。それとは対照的に、「グローバリゼーション」は常に必然的なものとして扱われている。明日太陽が昇るかについて意見を持つのはあまり意味がないのであると、おそらくアメリカで最も著名な新自由主義の擁護者であるトーマス・フリードマンは主張する（が、もちろん彼がその言葉を挙げることはない）。それを現実として受け入れ、その中で最善を尽くすしかないというのだ。[2] とにかくグローバリゼーションは起こった。誰の責任でもない。インターネットが何か関係しているかもしれない。いずれにせよ、今や私たちは皆、適応するしかないのだ。\n\n新自由主義を単に米国が自国のモデルを世界に押し付けているに過ぎないと感じている人からみれば、これら全ては完全に予想通りであろう。しかし、公平を期すと、ほとんどのアメリカ人が新自由主義という言葉を紛らわしいと感じるもっと無邪気な理由はたくさんある。米国では政治用語の発達が他の国々と大きく異なっている。例えば、19世紀には、リベラルという言葉は私有財産権を基礎とする個人の自由を信じる人々に対して用いられていた。これらの「古典的リベラル」とも呼ばれる人々は、個人的な問題と同様に、経済に対する政府の干渉を拒否する傾向があった。これは今でも世界のほとんどの国でリベラルが意味することである。しかし、米国では20世紀を通じて、この言葉は穏健左派によって採用され、「社会民主主義者」のような意味を持つようになった。1980年代から、右派はリベラルという言葉を非難の言葉に変えることで対抗した。リベラルは、多くの労働者階級のアメリカ人の心の中で、ラテを啜る文化エリート主義者、「課税と支出」の政治家、同性婚の推進者、そして同様の忌み嫌われる人々の呼称となった。一方、自由市場の熱狂的な支持者たち、つまり世界では「リベラル」と呼ばれている人たちは、新しい呼び名を探し始めた。結局彼らが最終的に決めた名前はリバタリアンで、それは左派から借用した用語であった。その結果、アメリカ人が政治について他国の人と話すことはさらに難しくなった。他の国々では、リバタリアンという言葉はアナーキストの同義語として伝統的な意味をほとんど残しているからだ。ヨーロッパや南米では、「リバタリアン的共産主義」について語ることは全く珍しくない。これは、国家を解体し、経済生活のコントロールを民主的に組織された共同体の手に委ねるべきだという考え方である。平均的な米国市民の前でこのような言葉を使えば、意図的な矛盾で他人を混乱させるのが好きな迷惑な人、あるいは狂った人だと思われるだろう。\n\n人々が相互に話すことができないのはいいことではあり得ないし、多くのアメリカ人が、世界における自分たちの役割に対する怒りが広がっていることに戸惑っているように見える今は特に残念なことだ。報道では、新自由主義への反対、特にラテンアメリカでの反対は、あたかも新自由主義が本当にアメリカの生活様式と単純に同一であるかのように、しばしば「反米主義」と呼ばれる。実際には、そうではない。実際、アメリカ人の大多数は新自由主義の核となる考え方や制度を否定しているという主張は十分に成り立つし、アメリカ人は実に、新自由主義的な「改革」の最初の犠牲者だ。それらは本巻で述べられている多くの不安定要因の究極的な原因となっている政策の数々である。アメリカ人も新自由主義に反対する世界的な運動の高まりの中で重要な役割を果たしてきたのは確かなのだ。\n\n上記が示唆するように、私はここで中立性を主張しているわけではない。世界的な貧困の根源や資本主義の本質について「客観的」あるいは「科学的」な説明をしていると主張する人は、よほど世間知らずか、何かを売りつけようとしているかのどちらかだと言っていいと思う。\n\n新自由主義の根源\n\n経済理論および政治理論としての新自由主義は、いくつかの比較的単純な前提に基づいている。最小限の概略は次のようなものだ。\n\n政府は経済への関与を最小限にとどめるべきである。さらに、政府には大規模な工業・商業企業を経営する能力はない。実際には、市場環境の中で利潤を追求して活動する民間企業は、公的機関よりも上手く公共サービスを提供することが常に期待できる。したがって政府は、民間企業が公共サービスを提供しやすい法的環境を整え、必要なインフラを整備することに専念するべきである。 貿易障壁を減らすことは常にいいことであり、常にすべての人に利益をもたらす。旧態依然とした保護主義的な政策は捨てるべきである。各国が自律的に発展しようとするのではなく、単一のグローバル市場において特定の「競争的優位性」（それが安価な労働力であれ、教育を受けた労働力であれ、天然資源であれ）を追求するべきである。 貧しい人々を利する政府の支出政策は、それが基本的な食料品の価格支持であれ、医療サービスの無料提供であれ、年金基金の保証であれ、究極的には逆効果である。それらは縮小されるか廃止されるべきである。市場の働きを歪めてしまうからだ。その代わり、自国通貨の安定を保証するために政府が支出を制限して均衡財政を維持すれば、外国からの投資に有利な市場環境が生まれ、市場そのものがこれらの問題のより良い解決策を提供する。\n\n1980年代以降、世界のほとんどすべての国が何らかの新自由主義改革を採用してきた。しかし、政治家がそのようにすると約束して当選したことが理由であるのは例外的だ。間違いなく、最初の新自由主義的実験は1970年代半ばにチリで、選挙で選ばれた政府を軍事クーデターで転覆させた後に将軍アウグスト・ピノチェトによって実施された。しかし、ほとんどの改革は武力による強制ではなく、財政的強制とでも呼ぶべきものであった。\n\nデヴィッド・ハーヴェイが指摘するように、真の転換点は、1975年に始まったニューヨーク市の金融危機である。[3] これは少し詳しく検討する価値がある。危機は市が財政破綻の瀬戸際に立たされている状態から始まった。連邦政府が救済措置を拒否し、投資銀行が債務のロールオーバーを拒否したため、ニューヨークは技術破産に追い込まれた。債権者たちはその後、市政府から独立した、つまり有権者に責任を負わされない、市政府援助公社（Municipal Assistance Corporation, MAC）と呼ばれる組織の設立を進め、市を救済する条件として市の政治的景観を作り替え始めた。当時のニューヨークはアメリカにおける社会民主主義の飛地のようなものだったことを忘れてはならない。全米で最も広範な家賃統制だけでなく、アメリカで最も労働組合が組織され、最も広範な公共サービスが提供され、唯一の無料の公立大学さえ維持されていた。予算を均衡させるという名目で、MACは自治体の労働組合の力を削ぎ、サービスを削減し、年金や雇用保証を後退させ、企業や開発業者に莫大な減税を提供し、市政のあり方そのものを再構築し始めた。\n\nまず第一に、市政がすべての市民のために平等に存在するという建前がなくなった。むしろ、市は売り込むべき商品だった。ロゴとジングルが発明された（ビッグ・アップル、アイ・ラブ・ニューヨーク）。市の中心部がそれ自身の煌びやかな広告塔として再建されるにつれ、貧困層は潜在的な観光客や投資家の目から遠ざけられることになった。消防隊の計画的な撤退により、サウスブロンクスやイースト・ニューヨークのような周辺地域は焼け野原と化した。アウター・ボローズの労働者階級にとって重要な、地下鉄のようなインフラは崩壊するままにされた。ニューヨーク市立大学は授業料を徴収せざるを得なくなった。同時に、市政府は投資家にとってより良い「ビジネス環境」を作ることを目的とした、ジェントリフィケーションキャンペーンや市中心部の新しい通信インフラ構築の支援に資金を注ぎ込んだ。\n\n1970年代後半から1980年代前半のニューヨークといえば、スタジオ54でコカインを嗅ぐ享楽的なヤッピーのイメージか、あるいは都市崩壊のイメージを思い浮かべるのが普通だ。グラフィティ、クラックハウス、ホームレスの蔓延など、当時はカルカッタやボンベイと比較された。こうしたイメージを可能にした貧富の差の拡大は、しばしば弁明者たちが主張するように、脱工業化や通信・サービス産業の成長の必然的な結果ではなかった。それらはニューヨーク市民の総意が選択したわけでもなく、また選択するはずもなかったであろう政治的判断の結果だ。公共財という考え方に哲学的に反対する金融業者によって事実上押し付けられたのである。しかし、その結果、新自由主義的倫理とでも呼ぶべきものが徐々に出現した。それは富裕層には個人の自己実現を、貧困層には「個人の責任」を同時に強調する。どちらも、民主主義が共同体に対する何らかの共通の献身を意味する（ましてや、共同体の構成員が共同体の民主的な生活に参加するために最低限必要なもの、食料、住居、自由な時間へのアクセスを保証されるべきである）という考え方の否定に依存しているように思われた。それを明言した数少ない政治家の一人であるマーガレット・サッチャーは、最も簡潔に次のように述べた。「社会というものは存在しない。」個人がいて、家族がいて、彼らの独立した利己的な決断の結果が民主的な選択なのだ。コミュニティが呼び起こされるとしたら、「アイ・ラブ・ニューヨーク」キャンペーンのように、単なるセールスギミックにすぎない。結局のところ、新自由主義の世界では売れるものすべてが現実そのものなのだから。自己のマーケティング能力以外に何も残されていない断片化された個人の感覚は当時の新興文化のあらゆるレベルに響いていた。ニューヨークのアートシーンの洗練されたポストモダニズムから、広告代理店によって識別されターゲットにされた消費者のアイデンティティの果てしない細分化まで。\n\nニューヨークの歴史は、政治家が地域社会と対立して当選することは滅多にないことを示すだけでなく [4]、いったん社会的トリアージのプロセスが既成事実として受け入れられてしまえば、政治家はしばしば、そのような政策が必ず巻き起こす混乱や暴力から中産階級や労働者階級の市民を守ると約束し、法と秩序を掲げて選挙に勝つことができることも示している。1990年代のニューヨークでのルドルフ・ジュリアーニの当選は、単に暴力と犯罪に執着する政治への長い退化の集大成に過ぎず、本質的には、1970年代の混乱の後始末をすることが目的であった。このパターンは世界各地の都市で何度も何度も再現されることになった。\n\n1980年代、第三世界の債務危機によって、レーガン政権は同じモデルを世界規模で適用し始めた。その債務危機の起源は、1970年代後半の石油輸出機構（OPEC）の石油禁輸に遡る。基本的に起こったことといえば、原油価格の高騰でOPEC諸国が突然大量の資金を手にし、すぐに、（その資金が投資されていた）欧米の銀行は資金の借り手を見つけられなくなったことである。その結果、「ゴーゴー・バンキング」の時代が到来し、銀行の担当者は世界中を飛び回り、その後に起こるであろう経済的大当たりの荒唐無稽な予測に基づいて、第三世界の指導者たちに高利融資を受け入れるよう積極的に説得しようとした。この資金の大部分は単に盗まれた。残りの多くは、（世界銀行を有名にした巨大なダムの数々など）誤った考えの壮大なプロジェクトに投資され、後に政府主導の開発という考えそのものの愚かさを示すために利用された。言うまでもなく、数年以内に多くの貧しい国々がデフォルトの瀬戸際に立たされた。この時点で、米国財務省は国際通貨基金（IMF）と緊密に協力し、いかなる場合にもこのような債務を償却しないという方針を固めた。[5] これは、お金の貸し手が一定のリスクを負うことを当然とするそれまでの経済学的正統性からの大きな逸脱であることを付言しておく。これは新自由主義の重要な要素を示している。貧困層は（現実のものであれ想像上のものであれ）不適切な経済的決断の責任を問われるが、富裕層は決して責任を問われないということだ。実質的な効果として、全額がスイスの個人銀行口座に直接振り込まれる可能性が高いことを十分承知していながら、銀行家が汚職に手を染めた独裁者に1億ドルを貸したとすると、たとえその独裁者がその後民衆の反乱によって追放されたとしても世界政府と金融機関の全機構が歩調を合わせ、独裁者のかつての犠牲者たちから寛大な金利で資金を回収できると主張することを銀行家は安心していられるのである。そのために何千人もの人が飢えなければならなくなったとしても、それは仕方のないことなのだ。\n\n革新的だったのは、単に債務の不可侵性を主張するだけでなく、ニューヨークのように債務を政治的手段として利用したことだ。[6] 融資はすぐに返済不能となり、借り換えを余儀なくされた。しかし、IMFがそうする前に、各国政府は新自由主義的なエコノミストたちによって考案された「構造調整プログラム」と呼ばれるものを受けることに同意しなければならなかった。彼らの最優先事項は常に財政均衡であり、それは表向きには安定した通貨と有利な投資環境を作り出すためだった。これは、最も劇的なものでは、燃料や基本的な食料品に対する価格支持の撤廃や、医療施設や初等教育のようなそれまで無料であったサービスに対する「利用者負担」の賦課など、社会サービスの削減によって主に行われた。これに伴い、公的資源を売却し、国内市場を外国貿易と投資に全面的に解放することになっていた。想像に難くないが、こうした政策は都市部の貧困層から絶えず反発を招いた。しかし、各国政府は選択の余地はなかったと言うことができた。それは正しかった。貧困国の指導者たちがIMFの協定への署名を真っ向から拒否した数少ない場面、例えば、1990年代初頭のマダガスカルの大統領アルベール・ザフィがそうだったが、彼らは、そうしなくては他のすべての国々が援助を打ち切ることになることをすぐに知った。援助がなければ民間資本は撤退し、保険補助がなければ製品を輸出することさえできなかった。効果は、少なくとも純粋に経済的荒廃という点では、小規模な核攻撃で達成されたかもしれないものとほぼ同等であった。[7]\n\n1980年代と1990年代はもちろん、ヨーロッパ、アフリカ、アメリカ大陸の大部分で独裁政権が選挙で選ばれた政府に取って代わられた時期だ。しかし、有権者は自分たちの選択が経済政策にほとんど何の影響も及ぼさないことをすぐに知ることになった。それは、同時に経済的な決定のレバーが政府の手から離れ、選挙で選ばれたわけでもない、説明責任のない新自由主義的テクノクラートの手に渡ったからである。これは負債によってのみ起きたのではない。この時代のもう一つの典型は、貿易協定を執行するための機関に経済問題の管轄権が移ったことである。例えば、1994年の北米自由貿易協定（NAFTA）の調印は、特には、革命の主要な遺産の一つであった集団エヒードを含むあらゆる形態の共同体的土地所有権の廃止を含む大規模な憲法改正をメキシコに約束させたが、この問題が選挙民の前に現れることはなかった。[8] ヨーロッパでは、EUの協定が同様の役割を果たし、ヨーロッパの新しい共通通貨の安定を維持するための財政均衡の名の下に、社会的な保護を撤廃し「柔軟な」労働体制を導入することを各国政府に強制した。その後すぐに、関税及び貿易に関する一般協定（GATT）、そして世界貿易機関（WTO）と、同様の貿易協定が世界中に拡大した。いずれの場合も、任命された官僚の組織が、労働条件や環境を保護するための法律を含め、過度に保護主義的と見做される法律を取り締まる権限を与えられていた。\n\n最も劇的だったのは東ヨーロッパと中欧ヨーロッパの事例であろう。1989年と1991年に共産主義が崩壊した直後に行われた調査では、ほとんどの国民が北欧風の社会福祉国家の創設を希望し、社会主義の維持に賛成する国民は極少数あり、純粋な自由市場モデルの導入に賛成する国民はほとんどいなかった。にもかかわらず、選挙で選ばれた政府が発足するやいなや彼らは一様に、まさにそのモデルをできる限り早く導入するために、外国で考案された「ショック療法」プログラムを実施し始めた。これらの国々はほとんどの場合、多額の負債を負っていなかったため、なおさら印象的であった。その頃には、それ以外の条件では世界経済との完全な統合は不可能になっていたようだ。[9]\n\n実際、1990年代には、新自由主義の方針に基づいて運営されるグローバル統治システムについて確信を持って語ることができるようになった。それは一連の階層から構成されることを想像してほしい。最上位にいるのは金融取引業者だ。ここ数十年の大きな革新の一つは、金融資本が巨大な花を咲かせたことである。現在の時点で、グローバル市場と呼ばれるものにおける経済取引の90%以上はもはやいかなる種類の商品の製造や取引とも直接の関係はなく、単に通貨取引やその他の形態の金融投機で成り立っている。トーマス・フリードマンが好んで呼ぶ「電子的な群れ」は、新自由主義の正統性を裏切っていると見做される「新興市場」から即座に資金を引き揚げることができるため、これは巨大な規律メカニズムとして機能する。このような通貨流出の影響は、繰り返しになるが、核爆発に匹敵するような意味合いを持つ。次の階層は多国籍企業で、その収入はほとんどの国のGDPをはるかに上回ることが多い。1980年代から1990年代にかけて、新聞社からデパート、建設会社まで、かつては独立していた何千もの企業が官僚主義的な路線で組織された巨大コングロマリットに吸収された。次に、IMF、WTO、EU、東南アジア諸国連合（ASEAN）、NAFTA、さまざまな準備銀行など、種々の通商官僚機構である。これらの官僚機構のエコノミストたちは、多国籍企業に従順な政策を主張するために、定期的に金融業者の脅威を喚起している。結局、非政府組織（NGO）が際限なく発展し、小児予防接種から農業融資まで、以前は国家政府の仕事と考えられていたサービスを提供するようになった。世界の金融取引の大部分を行う巨大な証券会社やヘッジファンドを含み、これらの階層はすべて、合わせて一つの巨大な、事実上の管理システムを構成している。これは人類史上初めての、実際に惑星規模の決定を執行する力を持つ行政システムである。結局のところ、全世界にまたがる帝国など存在したことはないし、最初の真のグローバル機関である国連も道徳的権威以上のものを持ったことはなかったからだ。階層的に組織化された大規模な行政システムを指す言葉はもちろんある。それは官僚機構と呼ばれている。この新しい行政システムの中で働く人々のほとんどが自分たちを官僚だと思いたがらないことは確かだ。そして確かにこれらの組織は、それが（ほぼ）取って代わろうとした政府官僚組織よりもはるかに分散化され、柔軟なやり方で運営される傾向にある。[10] しかし、惑星全体に渡る貿易官僚機構が、わたしたちが最も慣れ親しんでいるものとは異なって組織されることは予想されることだ。注目すべきは、その独裁があまりにも効果的であるため、豊かな国に住む人々のほとんどがその存在に事実上気付いていないことだ。\n\n帳簿の均衡\n\n新自由主義改革の支持者たちは通常、自分たちの処方箋が、しばしば彼らが言うように「苦い薬」であること、あるいは少なくとも当初は、「痛みが伴う」ものであることを認めるのを厭わなかった。その正当化とは、ここでもまたマーガレット・サッチャーが最も簡潔に言ったことだが、「代替案はない」ということだった。社会主義的な解決策は失敗し、グローバルな競争がそのままである限り、他に方法はなかった。「資本主義」（暗に新自由主義的資本主義）は、上手く機能する唯一のものであることが証明されたのだ。このフレーズはそれ自体重要な意味を持つ。というのも、わたしたちがいかに徹底的に国家や社会を企業として捉えているかを示しているからである。「何を目的として上手く機能するのか」と問うことをほとんど誰も思いつかなかったようだ。とはいえ、新自由主義の成功はほとんど経済成長によってのみ測られるという新自由主義自らの観点で評価したとしても、世界規模で見れば、新自由主義は著しく失敗していることが証明されている。\n\nここで、「自由市場改革」が1960年代と1970年代の国家主導の開発戦略の欠点に対する反動であったはずであることを思い出してほしい。数字はこの通りだ。1960年代と1970年代の世界の成長率は、それぞれ年平均3.5%と2.4%だった。1980年代の新自由主義改革期には、この数字は1.4%に低下し、1990年代における新自由主義的な「ワシントン・コンセンサス」期には1.1%に低下した。[11] その影響は、「自由貿易」の最大の受益者であるはずの発展途上国においてはさらに劇的であった。中国を除けば、[12] 最初の20年間で、グローバル・サウスの一人当たりの実質国内生産成長率は全体として年率3.2%であり、実際、当時の世界平均よりも高かった。新自由主義時代（1981年〜99年）の間にこれは0.7%に低下した。[13] 実際には多くの経済は縮小した。さらに、低成長は必ずと言っていいほど、ますます不平等な分配を伴っていた。各国のエリートがグローバル都市の煌びやかな大都市に居を構え、あるいはイーサネットで結ばれたゲーテッド・コミュニティに閉じこもるようになると各国政府は、かつてはすべての国民に最低限の社会的保護を保障するはずだった政策へのいかなる関与も放棄した。その結果、国際NGOが被害を抑えようとした一方で、ニューヨークと同様、一種の社会的トリアージが行われ、政府の役割は主に、貧困層や新たに貧困に陥った人々を一掃し、人目につかないようにすることであった。世界規模で見れば、識字率や平均寿命といった社会指標全体が劇的に低下した。[14]\n\nこれが一般に知られた知識でないとすれば、それは新自由主義の支持者が決して全体像について語らないためでもある。勝ち組と負け組が存在するのがグローバル市場の本質だと彼らは言う。そして、自分たちのアドバイスに最も忠実に従った者が勝者であることを証明しようとする。それゆえ、リトアニアはロシアより、ウガンダはアンゴラより、チリはブラジルより上手くいっているのだと。これですら、通常はかなりの量の帳簿操作が必要である。例えば1980年代、改革派は韓国や台湾のような「アジアの虎」の成功を指摘したがった。そのためには、両者とも、新自由主義者たちが推奨していることとは基本的に正反対の、重関税、公教育への大規模な政府投資、さらには政府主導の産業五カ年計画に依存してきたと言う事実を軽く扱う必要があった。ヨーロッパでは、言うまでもなく自由市場改革に最も熱心だったイギリスが、今ではアイルランドより低い生活水準を維持している。一方、ヨーロッパ諸国の中で、経済の最も大きな割合を社会福祉事業に割り当てているフィンランドは、世界経済フォーラムによると、今や米国に代わって最も経済競争力のある国となっている。[15] 同時に、過去10年間の世界経済における二大勝者、米国と中華人民共和国は、IMFの助言を最も組織的に無視できる立場にある。例えば、アメリカではあまり知られていないが、IMFは毎年、米国政府の巨大な財政赤字を非難し、関税や農業補助金の削減を要求している。米国ではIMFは強制力を持たないため、政府はそれを無視するだけである。[16] 米国の最大の債権者である中国は、他の発展途上国に適用される「規律」のほとんどすべてを回避してきた。例えばブラジルと同じ立場であれば、産業インフラのための無限の信用供与、ましてや外国の特許や著作権を組織的に無視するような政策を維持することは許されなかっただろう。中国の華々しい経済的成功の要となったのは、間違いなくこれらの政策である。\n\nIMFのエコノミストたちはもりろん、各国が彼らの政策提言を採用すると、しばしば悲惨な結果を招くことを承知している。彼らの反応はいつも同じだ。もっと苦い薬が必要だ。\n\nフィリピンの経済学者ウォルデン・ベロが言うように、これは控えめに言っても不可解なことだ。これらのエコノミストのほとんどは、民間部門と幅広く仕事をしてきた。民間企業が経済戦略を提言してもらうためにコンサルタントを雇い、提言された戦略が示された目標への到達に完全に失敗した場合、そのコンサルタントは通常解雇されることが予想されることを彼らは知っている。少なくとも、彼には別の戦略を打ち出すことが求められるだろう。同じエコノミストたちが、目立った肯定的な結果が見られないなか、ウルグアイやマリのような国々が何十年も毎年同じ政策を続けるように主張するとき、彼らの頭の中でウルグアイやマリの最善の利益を第一に考えているのが本当か疑わざるを得ない。[17] ウルグアイとマリのほとんどの人が、かなり早い段階からそうではないとの結論に達していたのは確かだ。\n\nこの件に関しては、多くの憶測が飛び交っている。デヴィッド・ハーヴェイは、新自由主義は世界的繁栄の戦略としては非効率的であったとしても、1970年代に革命運動や民主化運動によって広く脅かされていた階級権力を強固なものにするという点では驚くほど効果的であったと指摘している。（これに付け加えると、新自由主義政策の最大の受益者は、新興行政機関の職員たち自身だ。）ベロ自身も似たような主張をしているが、地政学的な観点からである。1970年代末には、ブラジルのような国々が重要な産業大国として台頭し、南半球の経済的地位が急速に向上したため、非同盟運動における南半球の政治的代表者たちは、世界経済の構造そのものに変化を求め始めていた。OPECの石油禁輸措置は、このような新たな経済力の発揮の中で最も劇的な現れでしかなかった。そうだとすると、構造調整は攻勢を鈍らせ、南半球の多くの国々を貧困化した従属国に変えるのに極めて効果的であることが証明された。とはいえ、この視点は、米国が新自由主義的な政策を通じて、避けられない事態を先送りにしていただけなのではないかという興味深い問題を提起している。これは言い換えれば、イマニュエル・ウォーラーステインの見解であり、彼は、金融資本という仮想世界の裏側を覗けば、少なくとも1960年代以降、アメリカの経済力が世界の他の国々に対して低下し続けていることがわかると指摘する。その主な理由は、全体的な生産性の低さだと彼は主張する。米国は書類上、世界で最も生産性の高い労働力を持っているように見えるが、これは統計が賃金労働者（米国ではほとんどどこよりも搾取されている）の生産性だけを測定し、管理職の生産性を測定しないからである。乱暴にいえば、米国では、ヨーロッパや東アジアで一人の幹部がする仕事を2、3人の幹部がしており、そして米国の幹部は5、6倍の給料を要求する。ウォーラーステインによれば、米国が世界各地で推進した新自由主義的改革の主な効果の一つは、他国でも同様に寄生的な経営者層の誕生を促すことであり、その結果、少なくとも他国が追いつく速度を遅らせる効果があった。インドと中国の急速な台頭は、このゲームがもうすぐ終わることを示唆している。[18]\n\n哲学としての新自由主義\n\n私たちはパラドックスに直面している。急進的な個人主義の哲学が、なぜ世界初のグローバル行政官僚機構を創設する正当な理由となったのか？\n\nここで、私たちは19世紀に立ち戻らなければならないと思う。古い自由主義と新自由主義に共通点があるとすれば、それは第一に、両者とも人間の自由を個人の財産を享受する能力として捉えていたこと、第二に、それにもかかわらず、両者とも自らを人類の歴史における進歩的、革命的勢力とさえ考えていたことである。\n\nこのような主張の政治的背景を簡単に検討してみよう。1647年のパトニー討論において、クロムウェル軍の急進派が、「すべての人間は、彼自身の自然な流れと領域で、生まれながらにして王であり、聖職者であり、預言者であり、」政府を含め「何人も立ち入ることのできない」自己と財産の唯一の所有者であると主張したとき、これは非常に急進的な主張であった。[19] 200年後、それは明らかにそうではなくなっていた。その頃、労働者運動は私有財産の政治的権力に対する根本的な挑戦を始めていた。一方、リベラルは左派の中でも私有財産と、特に市場経済を擁護する傾向が強かった。\n\nこれは、19世紀のリベラルが、彼らが一般的に主張していたように急進派ではなく、左翼ですらなかったと言っているのではない。多くは奴隷制や軍国主義に真っ向から反対し、個人の権利や普通選挙権を支持する人々だった。自由市場の熱狂的支持者はまた、アダム・スミスにならって、大規模な特許会社を政府がもたらした独占、真の経済競争の抑制と見做す傾向があった。リベラルの理想は、自律した個人や小規模な家族経営の企業が、グローバルな市場で商品を売買する世界だった。当時の大英帝国に好意的な見方が多かったとすれば、それは帝国がある程度、これらの理想を実践していたからである。例えば、市場開放には武力を行使したが、自国ではあらゆる保護主義を拒否した。東インド会社のような特許独占企業は世紀の初頭に解体されていたため、当時のイギリスの資本主義は実際に比較的小規模な家族経営の企業によるところが大きかった。最終的には、産業革命がもたらしたあらゆる蛮行によって、リベラルには賃金労働でさえ自由の方向への進歩であると見做すことができた。それは、資本家がそれまで大きく依存しており、そして世界的に見ればある程度は常に依存してきたし今でも依存している、奴隷制、負債隷属制、そして強制労働や拘束労働に比べればである。\n\nアメリカの資本主義はイギリス以上にリベラルの理想に近い形で始まったが、1870年代から1880年代にかけては全く異なる方向に進み始めた。その重要な革新は近代的な株式会社を創設したことである。会社設立許可は、何千人もの従業員を抱える株式会社を、法的には個人として扱うことを可能にし得たが、19世紀の大半は、運河や鉄道の建設など、特定の公共サービスを提供できる立場にある、地方の実業家に対して、地方自治体が与える特権と考えられていた。1880年代から1890年代にかけて、企業は永続的な地位を獲得しただけでなく、国家の経済を支配するようになっていた。20世紀、アメリカは世界にまたがる多国籍企業を率先して設立した。ジョヴァンニ・アリギが指摘しているように、米国がイギリスに代わって世界の支配者となったとき、米国は独自の官僚主義的な資本主義を持ち込んだ。[20] そのバトンは第二次世界大戦後に正式に引き継がれ、ルーズベルト大統領が最初に行ったことの一つが、私が新興のグローバル官僚機構と呼んだものの最初の枠組みを作ることだった。これらは、会議が開催されたニューハンプシャー州のスキーリゾートにちなんで、ブレトンウッズ機関と呼ばれるようになった。IMF、世界銀行、そしてWTOの前身であるGATTである。形式的には、新しく創設された国際連合の法的枠組みの傘下にあったが、やがてグローバル行政の効果的なシステムとして国際連合を覆い隠すようになった。[21] アリギはまた、イギリスとは異なり、最も強力だった頃のアメリカは自由貿易に特に力を入れていたわけではなかったと指摘する。イングランドのように自国市場を開放することはなかった。現在でも、アメリカの庇護のもとで「国際貿易」として計上される取引のおよそ3分の1は、貿易ではなく、内部組織構造において旧ソ連の企業とほとんど見分けがつかないような企業の、異なる支店間の単なる移転である。[22]\n\nでは、第二波の自由主義はどのようにこの中にはまるのか。それはウォーラーステインが「1968年の世界革命」と呼ぶものの観点からのみ理解できるように思える。1960年代後半、工業化された世界を揺るがした暴動、蜂起、学生運動は、資本主義に対する反乱であったが、同時に資本家が同盟を結んでいた福祉国家に対する反乱でもあった。彼らはまた、当時の「まともな」マルクス主義的反対派とレーニン主義体制の両方との完全な決別を宣言する傾向があった。1968年5月のパリの反乱者たちはフランス共産党とは一切関わりたがらなかった。彼らの反乱は、あらゆる抑圧的な社会慣習や官僚的制約に対する個人の解放、喜び、自己表現の名の下に起こったものだった。そして、1968年のアメリカにおける精神も同様だった。1960年代後半に大学に通った世代が制度的権力を握り始めたまさにその瞬間に、新自由主義が支配的なイドオロギーになったというのは偶然とは思えない。イデオロギーとしては、19世紀の自由主義がやったことと全く同じことをするように意図されているようだ。それは、資本主義のために、革命的なエネルギー、アイデア、さらには革命的な言語を取り戻すことである。\n\nここで最も良い例は、資本主義という言葉自体の歴史だろう。新自由主義のレトリックの重要な要素は、資本主義自体が革命的な力であるという考えである。こうした言葉遣いは、実はかなり新しいものである。少なくとも資本主義者の言葉としては。資本主義者は歴史的に資本主義という言葉を一度も使ったことがなく、自由企業、起業家精神、民間企業、経済的自由といった言葉を好んで使ってきた。資本主義という言葉は、批評家たちが、生産的資産が少数の人間によって自分たちの利益のために支配されている、汚らしい経済現実と見做すものを表現するのにほぼ独占的に使われていた。一方、「社会主義」は、生産的資産が公共の利益のために民主的に管理される世界という実現されていない理想だった。新自由主義時代の最も特徴的な知的な動きはこれをひっくり返したことだった。資本主義は実現されない理想、つまり完全に自由で自己調整された市場というユートピア的な夢となった。社会主義は政府による規制の汚れた現実だった。したがって、人類の幸福と自由におけるすべての進歩は資本主義によるものであり、すべての悪は社会主義の長引く影響によるものであるとされる。\n\nこれは伝統的な資本主義のレトリックではなかった。むしろ、それは一種の逆マルクス主義であった。興味深いことに、この言葉遣いは主に反対側からの亡命者によって最初にされた。最も悪名高いのはロシアの亡命者アイン・ランドだ。1946年に最初に出版された彼女の著書『資本主義：知られざる理想』は、1987年から2006年までアメリカ連邦準備制度理事会の議長を務め、新自由主義正統派の真の最高司祭となる若きアラン・グリーンスパンに大きな影響を与えた。極右の言葉遣いとして始まったものが、すぐにほぼあらゆる場所で採用されるようになった。1980年代までに、再評価された資本主義という言葉は、左派よりとされるニューヨーク・タイムズの編集長によって特別な目的で採用されたようだ。この時期、同紙はおそらく少なくとも100の異なる見出しと社説を掲載し、左派政権または政党が「資本主義」を受け入れることを余儀なくされたと発表した。マルクス主義体制の崩壊後、タイムズ紙のコラムニストたちは資本主義が急進的な力であるという考えに夢中になり、同紙上ではチェ・ゲバラが生きていたなら、純粋な革命的熱意から自由市場の改革者になったかどうかについて活発な議論が繰り広げれられた。\n\nこの文脈でのみ、絶対的な個人主義のレトリックがどのようにして新興の官僚機構の基盤となったのかを理解できると私は思う。それは革命の言葉とともに慌ただしく息を切らしながら到来した。問題は、これが単なる言語ではなく、それが引き起こした革命的な側面が、ほとんどの場合、最も悲惨なものだったことだ。実際、新自由主義の立場の本質はスターリン主義と、というのは、1920年代と1930年代にマルクス主義革命家が官僚国家の創設を正当化するために使った議論まで、驚くほど類似している。これを次のように要約できるだろう。「科学は、前進できる道は一つしかないことを示している。それは地球上のどの社会でも同じである。これを理解し、社会を適切に再構築する力を与えられるべき、科学的に訓練されたエリートがいる。この科学の訓練を受けていない人々の経済的な見解は無意味である。だから黙って言われたことをすることだ。たとえ短期的にはこれが大きな苦痛と混乱、さらには飢餓と死を引き起こすかもしれないとしても、いつかは（いつになるかは分からないが）、すべてが平和と繁栄の楽園につながるからだ。」\n\n1930年代にソ連の官僚がロシアの農民に説いたのと同じ主張が、今ではほぼすべての人に説かれている。唯一の大きな違いは、今では歴史的唯物論がミルトン・フリードマン流の自由市場経済学に取って代わられたことだ。1989年以来、ポーランドからベトナムに至るまで、多くの紛れもないスターリン主義者の官僚が一つの正統派から別の正統派へと簡単に切り替えることができたのも驚くには当たらない。根本的な飛躍はほとんど必要なかったのだ。\n\n明らかに、新自由主義的なグローバル官僚機構は、ユートピア的ビジョンを押し付けようとする点で、旧共産主義の官僚機構ほど直接的には介入していない。しかし、人生のあらゆる側面を市場の論理に従わせるという究極の理想は、金融家のジョージ・ソロスのような離反者が好んで指摘するように、その野望においてはむしろ、同等に全体主義的である。さらに、その効果の多くは不思議なほど類似している。ソビエト政権下では、イデオロギーの議論は言うまでもなく、政治生活は非合法だった。すべての政治的問題は解決済みとされた。残るのは、最終的には消費者の楽園を創り出すことを目指していることになっている、経済行政だけであった。その結果、中央に対して政治的主張ができる唯一の方法は、何らかの民族的、または文化的アイデンディティを主張することだった。例えば、カザフ人が原子力発電所を手に入れるとなれば、私たちウズベク人もそれを手に入れる資格があるはずだというように。アイデンティティ・ポリティクスは官僚機構が受け入れ可能と判断した唯一のものだった。その結果、これらの国家が解体すると、多くの国家が即座に民族間の戦争に陥った。かなり似たようなことが現在世界規模で起こっていることは明らかだ。特に共産主義の崩壊は、イデオロギー的、つまり政治的な議論が終わったことを意味すると解釈された。その結果、アイデンディティ・ポリティクスは正当であると見做されるだけでなく、非常に現実的な意味で完全に正当であると見做される唯一の政治形態になった。場合によっては、グローバル官僚機構との繋がりは非常に明確だ。既に指摘したように、新自由主義はあらゆる集団的財産形態を排除することを目指しており、唯一許容される例外は「先住民」に分類される人々である。その結果、世界中で先住民族としての地位を主張する試みが相次ぎ、その中には、以前は自分たちを先住民族と称することなど夢にも思わなかった多くの集団（ケニアの牧畜民マサイ族など）も含まれる。もっと広い視点で見れば、サミュエル・ハンチントンの、イデオロギーの時代が終わった今、残っているのは「文明の戦争」（つまり、宗教と文化のアイデンティティ）だけだという主張は、他のあらゆる歴史の終焉を宣言しようとすることの論理的帰結を完璧に表現している。\n\n代替手段、あるいは「何を目的として上手く機能するのか」\n\nマルクス主義のより粗雑な変種から借用したこの二元論的枠組みがなければ、「共産主義は失敗した」ので、どこにも存在したことのない、純粋な自由市場資本主義という理想を目指す以外に選択肢はないと主張することは不可能だろう。そうでなければ、この議論は、聖公会との長い闘いの後にカトリック教会が崩壊するのを目の当たりにして、したがって私たち全員がバプテスト（あるいはユダヤ教徒）にならなければならないと結論付ける人の議論と同じくらい意味をなさないだろう。歴史をもっと冷静に評価すれば、冷戦に勝つ最も効果的な方法は、限られた社会福祉プログラムと、経済を刺激するための政府の巨額の軍事費の組み合わせであるという結論に至ったように私には思える。また、貧しい国々が豊かな資本主義諸国に経済的に追いつくための最も効果的な方法は、市場の力、主要産業の保護、戦略的な輸出、教育とインフラへの大規模な政府投資を組み合わせたことであると。そして、世界の人口の約10%に可能な限りの物質的生活と最大限の自由を与え、一方で下位3分の1を狼の手に投げ捨てることが目的であるならば、新自由主義こそが間違いなく最善の策であると。また、これらはどれも、「普通の人々が基本的なニーズを満たし、自分にとって最も重要なことを自由に追求できる世界を実現する最も効果的な方法は何か」あるいは「地球が破壊されないようにするにはどうすればいいか」などの他の疑問とは必ずしも関係がないように思える。\n\n資本主義そのもの、少なくとも産業資本主義は、歴史的に見て非常に短い期間しか存在していない。しかし、わずか200年の間に、種の存在そのものに対する脅威を生み出す驚くべき能力を示してきた。最初は核による壊滅、今度は地球規模の気候変動だ。これは長期的には実現可能なシステムではないと信じる十分な理由がある。最も明白なのは、これが継続的な成長の必要性を前提としており、資源が有限な地球では経済成長は永遠に続くことはできないからだ。生産を継続的に拡大する必要性に基づかない資本主義は、単に資本主義ではないだろう。その根本的な力学は変化し、何か別のものに変わるだろう。50年後にどのような経済システムが支配的になるにせよ、それは資本主義以外のものになる可能性が非常に高い。もちろん、その何かはさらに悪いかもしれない。だからこそ、今はまさに資本主義に代わるものを想像すること、つまり、実際に何がより良いのかという考えを出すことを諦めるには間違った時期であるように思える。\n\nだからこそ、私にとって、新自由主義に対する抵抗運動は非常に重要なのだ。これらは、1980年代に世界のほとんどの地域でほとんどすぐに始まり、主に何らかの共有財産を守るための草の根運動を中心に形作られた。[23] 当初、それらはほとんど繋がってなかった。1994年にチアパスで起きたサパティスタの反乱は重要な瞬間だった。実際、サパティスタが最初に国際会議を主催し、それが最終的にメディアが「反グローバリゼーション」運動と呼ぶようになった運動を生み出した。サパティスタが言うように、「人類のために、そして新自由主義に反対する」真に世界的な運動だ。1999年11月のシアトルでのWTO会議、その後のワシントンとプラハ（IMFに対して）、ケベック（米州自由貿易協定[FTAA]に対して）、そしてジェノア（G8に対して）での目を見張る大規模な行動はすべて、何よりもまず、世界経済政策を統制するようになった組織の非民主的な性質を世界に明らかにすることが目的だった。言い換えれば、彼らは、世界のほとんどの人々が明白な結論を導き出すだろうと言う仮定のもとに、この新たなグローバル官僚機構の存在そのものを指摘する役割を果たした。この点で彼らは驚くほど成功した。2年も経たないうちに、1990年代には自明の真理として扱われていた新自由主義の主要教義のほとんどが、あらゆるところで疑問視され始めた。WTOを拡大し、FTAA条約のような新しい貿易協定を締結するという野心的な計画は、完全に頓挫した。\n\n実のところ、テロとの戦いが米国の活動家や国民の注意を逸らし始めて以来、新自由主義の元々の仕組みのほとんどが危機に陥っていることに誰も気づいていないというのは少々皮肉なことだ。2006年にWTOの「ドーハ・ラウンド」は失敗と宣言され、WTOの存在そのものが疑問視されている。IMFは、むしろさらに深刻な危機に陥っている。2002年にアルゼンチン経済が崩壊し、真に政治階級全体に対する民衆の反乱が起こった後、2003年に選出された社会民主党の大統領ネストル・キルチネルは、政府という概念そのものの正当性を回復するために劇的な行動を取らなければならなかった。そこで彼は、アルゼンチンの対外債務のデフォルトを起こした。これはまさにIMFが起こらないようにしなければならなかったはずのことであり、国際銀行家たちはIMFに、アルゼンチンに介入して罰するように促したが、ついにその時はそれができなかった。これにはさまざまな理由があった（部分的には世界的な運動によってIMFが社会の除け者にされていたという事実、部分的にはそもそもその破滅的なアドバイスがアルゼンチンの危機の大きな原因であったことを誰もが知っていたこと）が、結果的に負債による権力構造全体が崩壊し始めた。アルゼンチンとブラジルはIMF債務を全額返済し、その後すぐに、ベネズエラのオイルマネーの助けもあり、ラテンアメリカの他の国々も続いた。（2003年から2007年の間に、ラテンアメリカのIMFに対する総負債額は98.4%減少し、これで彼らの借りは基本的に無くなった。）ロシア、インド、中国もこれに追随し、韓国、タイ、マレーシア、インドネシア、フィリピンなどとともに、現在では新たな融資について話し合うことさえ拒否している。その結果、アフリカを支配する立場に大きく落ち込んだIMF自体、急速に破産に陥りつつある。世界銀行は存続しているが、収入は大幅に減少している。\n\nこうしたことはすべて、米国民の目を逃れて起こっているようだ。一方、世界のほとんどの国では、これまでと異なるより人道的な世界経済がどのようなものになるかについて、活発な議論が続いている。米国では、この運動は改革主義（「反企業主義」）と革命主義（「反資本主義」）のアプローチの間で大きな議論を巻き起こしてきた。世界の多くの国では、こうした議論は国家の潜在的な役割に焦点が当てられるようになった。国家政府の庇護のもとで新しい形のコモンズ（土地、水、石油などの共有資源に対する権利の回復）の創出を望む人々と、国家を完全に拒否し、事実上ある種の自由主義的共産主義を通じて、国境や政府官僚機構のない、直接民主主義を通じて資源を管理する自由なコミュニティの連合体の上に築かれた、いわゆる「真のグローバリゼーション」の世界を夢見る人々を対立させながら。こうした対話から何が生まれるのか、新しい民主主義の形が実際に生まれるのか、それとも世界的な官僚機構の構造の再編が見られるだけなのかを判断するのは時期尚早だ。新自由主義は決して死んではいない。インドや中国など新興国では、国際的な反対勢力を結集することがはるかに難しい中で、同様の改革が大規模に行われている。しかし、私たちはその議論の数々に注意を払うべきだろう。なぜなら、それらは人類の未来の歴史にとって決定的なものとなるかもしれないからだ。\n\n[1]

Generally speaking, I think it’s a good thing that the sun comes up every morning. It does more good than harm . . . . But even if I didn’t much care for the dawn there isn’t much I could do about it.\" (私はグローバリゼーションについて、夜明けについて感じるのと同じように感じる。一般的に言って、私は太陽が毎朝昇るのはいいことだと思う。それは害よりも益をもたらす。しかし、私が夜明けをあまり気にしていなかったとしても、それについて私にできることはあまりない。) Thomas Friedman, The Lexus and the Olive Tree(New York: Anchor Books, 2000), xxi–xxii.\n\n[3] David Harvey, A Brief History of Neoliberalism (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005).\n\n[4] サッチャーはこの点では例外のようなものだったが、彼女でさえ一般投票の3分の1以上を獲得したことはなかった。\n\n[5] より正確に言えば、利息は元本にカウントされない。1980年代半ばまでに、ほとんどの貧しい国々は実際に借りた金額よりも返済した金額の方が遥かに多かった。しかし、金利は全額返済を事実上不可能にするほど高く設定されていた。\n\n[6] 債務救済を政治改革に結びつけるというアイデアは、レーガン政権の国務長官ジェームズ・ベーカーの発案で、ベーカー・プランとして知られるようになった。\n\n[7] マダガスカルの事例は、非暴力革命によって、かつての独裁者ディディエ・ラツィラカに取って代わった政権を握った外科医ザフィがIMFの助言を聞いて豊かになった貧困国の例を一つ挙げろとIMFに要求する不遜さを持っていたため、なおさらよくわかる。彼が署名を拒否した後、経済的荒廃によって、次の選挙で政策の撤回を誓ったラツィラカに敗れた。5年後、ラツィラカは再び民衆の蜂起によって追放されたが、今度は新自由主義的なヨーグルト王によってである。\n\n[8] NAFTAに調印した政府が選挙で正当に選ばれたのではなく、詐欺によって勝利したことを考慮すれば、なおさらである。\n\n[9] Janine WedelのCollision and Collusion: The Strange Case of Western Aid to Eastern Europe, 1989– 1998 (New York: St. Martin’s Press, 1998)を見よ。Wedelは、この驚くべき物語を語った最初の人類学者である。\n\n[10] この大きなシステムと各国政府との関係は新自由主義の時代を通じて大きく変化した。当初は、政府そのものが問題であるとして広く描かれた。その単純な除去は、市場メカニズムの自然発生に繋がると考えられていた。しかし、投資家たちはすぐに、貪欲を公然と奨励し政府という概念そのものを軽んじることで、極端な腐敗が助長され、それがビジネスの邪魔になることに気づいた。東ヨーロッパの多くで「ショック療法」が自由市場ではなく、無法な「ギャング資本主義」をもたらした後ではなおさらだ。クリントン政権下では、「適切な統治」という考え方に重点が移され、特に外国投資に資する誠実な法環境を維持する必要性が強調された。\n\n[11] World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalization, A Fair Globalization: Creating Opportunities for All (Geneva: International Labour Office, 2004); UN Development Program, “Human Development Report,” 1999, and “Human Development Report,” 2003.\n\n[12] 中国が除外されているのにはいくつかの理由がある。最初の期間は、自国主義的な政策によって、ある程度は大きなシステムの外に置かれていた。次の期間では、政府は新自由主義政策の主要な原則を劇的に誇示しつつ、他の発展途上国が放棄を余儀なくされていたような計画、保護、容易な信用取引条件を戦略的に展開していた。\n\n[13] Robert Pollin, Contours of Descent: U.S. Economic Fractures and the Landscape of Global Austerity (London: Verso, 2003).\n\n[14] 統計が曖昧に見えることがあるとすれば、それはこれらの数値の多くが東アジアの大部分で改善したためであり、通常、医療や教育の縮小や民営化を求めるIMFの圧力に抵抗した国々こそ改善したのである。アフリカとラテンアメリカでは抵抗できる国がほとんどなかったため、数値は劇的に低下した。\n\n[15] フィンランドは2004年以来、特別な位置を占め続けている。世界経済フォーラムの2004-5年ランキングでは、フィンランドに次いで米国、スウェーデン、台湾、デンマーク、ノルウェーの順となっている。注目すべきは、上位6カ国には、新自由主義の正統派を支持する国は一つも含まれていないことだ。というのも、アメリカ自身は、他国政府に促している戒律のほとんどを常日頃から反故にしているからだ。レポート全文は、World Economic Forum, “Global Competitiveness Report 2004–2005,” October 2004, www.weforum.org/en/initiatives/gcp/Global% 20Competitiveness%20Report/PastReports/index.htmを参照。\n\n[16] これは、経済学の古臭い知恵の完璧な例と言えるかもしれない。「銀行から100万ドル借りれば、銀行はあなたを所有する。銀行から1億ドル借りれば、あなたが銀行を所有する。」\n\n[17] Walden Bello, Future in the Balance: Essays on Globalization and Resistance (Oakland, CA: Food First Books, 2001). See also Walden Bello, Dark Victory: The United States, Structural Adjustment, and Global Poverty (Oakland, CA: Institute for Food and Development Policy, 1994).\n\n[18] Bello, Dark Victory; Harvey, Brief History of Neoliberalism; Immanuel Wallerstein, The Decline of American Power: The U.S. in a Chaotic World (New York: New Press, 2003).\n\n[19] この言葉はRichard OvertonのAn Arrow against All Tyrants (Exeter: Rota, 1976)からのものである。所有的個人主義の政治理論に関する最良の論考はC. B. MacPherson, The Political Theory of Possessive Individualism (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1962)にある。\n\n[20] Giovanni Arrighi, The Long Twentieth Century: Money, Power, and the Origins of Our Times(London: Verso, 1994).\n\n[21] IMFが国連の傘下で運営されているという事実は、国連の世界人権憲章が、すべての人間には食料と住まいの権利があると定めていることを考えると、とりわけ皮肉なことである。そのような権利を執行する能力はこれまであまり示されてこなかった。しかしIMFは、そのような原則に触発された政策を実施しようとする国に対して極めて組織的にかつ効果的に介入してきた。\n\n[22] 1980年代と1990年代には、特に一次産業のアウトソーシングや、アジアに触発された新しい「ジャスト・イン・タイム」生産戦略によって、官僚組織の一部に市場要素が導入された。その一方で、所有の集中も前例のないほど進んだ。例えば、米国のほぼすべてのデパートが現在メイシーズ・リテール・ホールディングスという一つの企業によって所有されていることを知っているアメリカ人はほとんどいない。つまり、企業の官僚機構はより柔軟になったが、はるかに大きくなった。\n\n[23] 資本主義におけるさまざまな「コモンズ」の重要性に関する最も鋭い分析は、ミッドナイト・ノーツ・コレクティブによって行われた。彼らは、資本主義者がコミュニティの集団的利益のために管理するあらゆる形態の共有財産が民営化されるか、あるいは排除される世界を望む一方で、自らの利益のために新たな形態のコモンズの創造も推進していることを最初に強調した。例えば、研究、輸送、廃棄物処理、新しく精巧なセキュリティ機能に対する共同責任などだ。そのため、集団的資源の定義と管理をめぐる闘争は、21世紀の南米の社会主義者や中東のイスラーム運動など、一見互いにほとんど関係がないように見える世界的な抵抗闘争の共通テーマとなっている。この考え方への最良の入門として、“Midnight Notes Collective,” last updated January 4, 2005, www.midnightnotes.org/index2.htlを見よ。",

While \"Conclave\", a film about the \"murky web of curial politics\", is getting Oscar-season buzz, in the real-world Vatican \"a series of events has unfolded behind the Leonine Walls in past months that are just as intriguing\". With only one lung, the fragile 88-year-old Pope Francis sparks alarm with \"every cough or hospital admission\". Around him, the vultures circle – devising strategies to ensure their preferred candidate becomes the next leader of the Catholic Church and its 1.4 billion faithful.\n\nOn one side are Francis's progressives, who want to modernise the Church; on the other, conservative traditionalists who fear \"a shift too far on issues of capitalism, homosexuality, abortion and the role of women\". This week, an unabashed Pope Francis appointed an Italian nun, Sister Raffaella Petrini, to run the Vatican City State – the first time a woman has ever been given the role. Women make better managers than men, said the Pope, adding: \"Women have been running things since the Garden of Eden.\"\n\nIt's all part of Francis's restructuring of Vatican affairs, said Mikael Corre in La Croix (Paris). Under his leadership, some 20 women have been appointed to senior positions in the Holy See, \"from the governing board of the Financial Information Authority to the Secretariat of State, the Vatican Library and the Museums\". The ultimate aim, Francis says, is to incorporate women into every part of ecclesiastical life.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

A Vatican employee, identified only by the initials G.F., claims the Argentinian Pope has \"surrounded himself with Spanish-speaking favourites with progressive agendas\", and that the Vatican is in the grip of two distinct lobbies: a powerful gay clique on the one hand, and the left-wing Santa Marta club on the other. To join the latter, says G.F., \"you have to be green, pro-migrant and above all pro-Palestinian. For them, Nicolás Maduro is a saint and Donald Trump is a devil.\"\n\nFrancis should \"brace\" himself for a battle, said John Kenneth White in The Hill (Washington DC), particularly in the US, where a \"conservative wave\" has flooded the Church. More than half of the country's 3,500 priests described themselves as \"conservative/orthodox\" or \"very conservative/orthodox\" in a recent survey; not one priest ordained after 2020 described himself as \"very progressive\". Meanwhile, President Trump has launched his own \"frontal assault on the papacy\" by appointing Brian Burch – a firebrand anti-Francis \"agitator\" – as his US ambassador to the Vatican.\n\nIt makes for a dramatic final chapter of a pontificate, said Damian Thompson on UnHerd (London). The next conclave \"can't be far off\", but for now Francis remains, combative and compulsively secretive. The Cardinals wait patiently, \"sharpening their knives\".",
